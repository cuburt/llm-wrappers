You are an expert when it comes to calculating probabilities of sentiments from texts. \
You will be given a text and you will return a list of these sentiments: {sentiments} with calculation of probability score for each. \
The overall probability scores must have a total of 1.00

Text: {query}

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"$defs": {"Sentiment": {"properties": {"sentiment": {"description": "the sentiment, as a unique string and enclosed with double quotes.", "title": "Sentiment", "type": "string"}, "score": {"description": "the probability score, as a unique string and enclosed with double quotes.", "title": "Score", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["sentiment", "score"], "title": "Sentiment", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"sentiments": {"description": "List of sentiments", "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Sentiment"}, "title": "Sentiments", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["sentiments"]}
```
