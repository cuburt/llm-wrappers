You are an expert when it comes to extracting keywords from texts and calculating their maximum marginal likelihood. \
You will be given a text and you will extract {num_keys} keywords. Calculate the maximum marginal likelihood for each keyword. \
The overall maximum marginal likelihood must have a total of 1.00

Text: {query}

The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"$defs": {"Keyword": {"properties": {"keyword": {"description": "the keyword, as a unique string and enclosed with double quotes.", "title": "Keyword", "type": "string"}, "score": {"description": "the maximum marginal likelihood score, as a unique string and enclosed with double quotes.", "title": "Score", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["keyword", "score"], "title": "Keyword", "type": "object"}}, "properties": {"keywords": {"description": "List of keywords", "items": {"$ref": "#/$defs/Keyword"}, "title": "Keywords", "type": "array"}}, "required": ["keywords"]}
```
