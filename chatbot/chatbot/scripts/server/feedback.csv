2024-08-11 21:02:36.563587 UTC,How to run Testng tests?,"To run TestNG tests in your Iris application, you need to set up TestNG within your project, configure your tests, and execute them. Here's how you can get started:

1. **Include TestNG Dependency:** Add the TestNG library to your project. You can do this by adding the TestNG dependency to your project's build file (often called `pom.xml` for Maven projects). This dependency allows your project to use TestNG for running tests.

2. **Write TestNG Tests:** Create TestNG test classes that contain your test methods. These test classes will be marked with the `@Test` annotation to indicate which methods should be executed as tests. You'll use TestNG's assertions to validate the expected behavior of your code.

3. **Configure TestNG Suite:** You can group your tests into a TestNG suite, which allows you to run a set of tests together. Create an XML file (often named `testng.xml`) that defines your suites and includes your test classes. This file provides flexibility in organizing and running your test scenarios.

4. **Execute TestNG Tests:** Run your TestNG tests from within your IDE or through the command line. Your IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ) typically provides options for running TestNG tests directly from the project view, or you can use the `testng.xml` file to run tests via the command line.

For detailed guidance on setting up TestNG, creating tests, defining suites, and execution in your Iris project, consult the official Iris documentation or the TestNG documentation. These resources will provide specific instructions and code examples for your development environment. 

Remember that TestNG provides various features for test management, reporting, and advanced test settings. You can explore those features within TestNG's documentation to tailor your testing process for your specific needs.

2024-08-11 06:01:29.219938 UTC,How to detect shake events in iOS channel,"You can detect shake events in your iOS VoltMX app using the `voltmx.accelerometer.registerAccelerationEvents` function.  This function registers event handlers for specific acceleration events, including 'shake'.  Here's a breakdown of how to use it:

1.  **Enable the Accelerometer API:** Ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to access device sensors if your application is using the accelerometer API.
2.  **Add an Event Handler:** Create a function that will handle the 'shake' event.  This function might perform an action like displaying an alert, triggering another function, or updating your UI based on the 'shake' gesture.
3.  **Register the Event:**  Use the `voltmx.accelerometer.registerAccelerationEvents` function to register your event handler for the 'shake' event.

Here's a code example showing the general structure:

```javascript
// Function to handle the 'shake' event
function handleShake() {
    // Your code to perform actions when a shake event occurs.  
    // For example, you might display an alert message:
    alert(""Device Shaken!"");
}

// Register the 'shake' event handler
voltmx.accelerometer.registerAccelerationEvents({ 
  shake: handleShake // Assign the handleShake function to the 'shake' event 
});
```

Key points to remember:

*   **Platform Compatibility:**  This approach should work on both iOS and Android, but you may need to adapt your handling logic if you are implementing other device-specific functionalities. 
*   **Error Handling:**  It's essential to include error handling in your code to deal with situations where the accelerometer data might not be available or if there are issues registering the event. 
*   **Other Acceleration Events:**  Keep in mind that the `voltmx.accelerometer.registerAccelerationEvents` can also register other acceleration events, such as 'x', 'y', and 'z', for continuous monitoring of device motion. 
*   **VoltMX Documentation:**  For more detailed information and examples on using the Accelerometer API in VoltMX Iris, refer to the official VoltMX documentation. You can search for ""Accelerometer API"" to find the appropriate documentation.

By leveraging the `voltmx.accelerometer.registerAccelerationEvents` function and registering your event handler for the 'shake' event, you can effectively detect and respond to shake gestures within your VoltMX iOS application.

2024-08-11 06:25:32.944696 UTC,how to enter only numbers in a textbox?,"To enter only numbers in a textbox in VoltMX Iris, you have a few options:

1. **Use the `onTextChange` event:**  You can use this event to filter out any non-numeric characters as a user types.  Here's a code example using JavaScript:

   ```javascript
   function txtNumber_onTextChange(text) {
       // Replace any non-numeric characters with an empty string
       var newText = text.replace(/[^0-9]/g, '');
       this.view.txtNumber.text = newText;
   }
   ```

   **Explanation:**

   *   **`txtNumber_onTextChange(text)`:** This function is called whenever the text inside the `txtNumber` textbox widget changes.  The `text` parameter holds the current value of the textbox.
   *   **`var newText = text.replace(/[^0-9]/g, '');`:** This line of code uses JavaScript's `replace()` method to filter out non-numeric characters.  It replaces any characters that are NOT digits (0-9) with an empty string. 
   *   **`this.view.txtNumber.text = newText;`:**  This line updates the `txtNumber` textbox with the filtered `newText` value.

2.  **Use the `keyboardType` property:**  You can set the keyboard type to numeric, limiting the keyboard to numbers only. 

    *   **Open your project:**  Open the project in VoltMX Iris where you want to restrict the textbox. 
    *   **Select the TextBox** In the form editor, select your TextBox widget.
    *   **Go to Properties:**  On the right side, in the Properties Panel, locate the ""General"" tab.
    *   **Change `keyboardType`:**  Set the `keyboardType` property to `NUMERIC`.

   **Example:**

   ```javascript
    this.view.txtNumber.keyboardType = ""NUMERIC"";
   ```

   This will ensure that only the numeric keyboard appears when the user interacts with the textbox.   

Remember to test both of these approaches to see which works best for your specific app and user interface design.

* **Low-Code/No-Code Approach:** The Data Panel's interface lets you work without writing complex code for data integration. 
* **Seamless User Experience:**  The Data Panel ensures data is fetched, processed, and displayed efficiently.

**Example:**

Let's say you have an Integration Service called `getContacts` that retrieves a list of contacts from your back-end system. You can use the Data Panel to:

1. **Map the Service:**  Select the `getContacts` service in the Data & Services panel.  Map the service response parameters to your UI elements (e.g., a segment widget, a list view).
2. **Generate Code:** Click ""Generate Code"" to view the mappings automatically created based on the mapped parameters you set.

This will generate JavaScript code that invokes the `getContacts` service and populates the UI elements with the retrieved data.

For detailed instructions on using the Data Panel, refer to the VoltMX Iris documentation.

2024-08-09 05:26:40.171239 UTC,How to embed a Cordova application?,"To embed a Cordova application into your VoltMX Iris project, you can utilize the **CordovaBrowser Widget**.  This widget acts as a bridge, allowing you to seamlessly integrate your existing Cordova application within your VoltMX app. 

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Create a New VoltMX Iris App:** Begin by creating a new VoltMX Iris project.
2. **Add the CordovaBrowser Widget:**  Add the CordovaBrowser widget to your form design in VoltMX Iris Studio.
3. **Configure the CordovaBrowser Widget:**
    * **Set the 'src' attribute:**  This is the most important configuration.  Provide the path to the HTML file that acts as the entry point for your Cordova application. 
    * **Customize the widget (Optional):** You can define various properties associated with the CordovaBrowser widget, such as its dimensions, position, and more.
4. **Include the 'com.voltmx.sdk' package:** In your Cordova project, make sure to include the 'com.voltmx.sdk' package. This package is a core component that facilitates the communication and integration between your Cordova application and VoltMX. You can obtain this package from the 'voltmx-phonegap-sdk-sdk' folder. Copy the 'com.voltmx.sdk' folder and paste it into the root directory of your Cordova project. 
5. **Add Required Plugins (If Any):** If your Cordova application depends on specific Cordova plugins, ensure you import these plugins into your VoltMX project. You can use the 'Manage Cordova Plugins' feature in the Edit menu to add plugins to your project. 
6. **Build and Deploy:** Once you've configured the CordovaBrowser widget and have the necessary plugins imported, build and deploy your VoltMX app. Now, your Cordova application will seamlessly run within your VoltMX project.

**Essential Considerations:**

* **Cordova Application Compatibility:** Ensure that your Cordova application, including its HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and any used Cordova plugins, is compatible with the target platform of your VoltMX Iris project.
* **VoltMX SDK Integration:**   The VoltMX SDK included in the 'com.voltmx.sdk' package is crucial for the CordovaBrowser widget to function correctly. You must implement the SDK correctly in your Cordova application.
* **Review Documentation:**  Consult the **CordovaBrowser Widget** documentation within the **VoltMX Iris Widget Programmer's Guide** for in-depth details on its configuration and for additional guidance on successfully embedding your Cordova app.

Remember, by using the CordovaBrowser Widget, you can leverage the capabilities of Cordova within the VoltMX framework. This empowers you to create hybrid applications that combine the best features of both technologies.

However, you can achieve a similar effect by managing UI element visibility and applying appropriate security practices.

* **UI Element Visibility:** If you want to hide certain UI elements, you can use the `isVisible` property of those elements. Set this property to `false` in the `onBackground` event handler of your application. This will make the elements invisible when your app transitions to the background.

```javascript
function onBackground() {
  // Hide specific UI elements 
  var myElement = kony.ui.getWidget(""myElementId"");
  myElement.isVisible = false; 
}

voltmx.application.registerEvent(""onBackground"", onBackground);
```

* **Data Security:** If you have sensitive data displayed on your UI, you should prioritize protecting it for all states, including the background. Use encryption mechanisms to securely store and transmit sensitive information, implement access control measures, and restrict data access based on user roles.

While there might not be a direct ""masking UI"" feature, employing the UI element visibility and data security measures is a good approach to manage your application's behavior during background transitions.

Here's how you can create an Image object from a snapshot:

1. **Capture the snapshot using the camera API:**
   ```javascript
   voltmx.camera.captureImage(
     function(successCallback) {
       // Success callback. You'll get the rawBytes here.
       var rawBytes = successCallback;
       // Create the Image object using the captured rawBytes.
       var imageObj = voltmx.image.createImage(rawBytes);
       // Do something with the image object.
     },
     function(errorCallback) {
       // Error callback.
     },
     {
       width: 1080, // Set the desired width of the captured image.
       height: 1920, // Set the desired height of the captured image.
       encode: voltmx.image.ENCODE_JPEG // Set the encoding type.
     } 
   );
   ```

2. **Create the Image object:**
   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have the rawBytes from the captured image.
   var imageObj = voltmx.image.createImage(rawBytes);
   ```

**Explanation:**

* **`voltmx.camera.captureImage`**: This API captures an image from the camera. It takes three parameters:
    * **successCallback**: A function that is called when the image capture is successful. This function receives the rawBytes of the captured image as its parameter.
    * **errorCallback**: A function that is called if there is an error capturing the image. 
    * **options**: An object containing options for the capture process (width, height, encoding type, etc.).

* **`voltmx.image.createImage`**: This API creates an Image object from the provided rawBytes.

**Key Points:**

* Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the device's camera.
* You can adjust the `width`, `height`, and `encode` options of the `voltmx.camera.captureImage` API to customize the captured image.
* Remember to handle both success and error scenarios appropriately.

1. **First, capture the image using the camera API:**

   ```javascript
   voltmx.camera.captureImage(
     function(successCallback) {
       // Success callback. `successCallback` contains the rawBytes.
       var rawBytes = successCallback;
       // Convert the rawBytes to base64.

2024-08-09 05:30:59.531614 UTC,what does voltmx.runOnMainThread do?,"The `voltmx.runOnMainThread` API in VoltMX Iris helps you execute JavaScript code on the main thread. This is an asynchronous API, meaning it doesn't block the current thread while it executes the code. It works by sending a message to the main thread to invoke a specified function with any provided parameters.

Here's how it works:

1. **Asynchronous Execution:** When you call `voltmx.runOnMainThread`, it doesn't immediately execute the code. Instead, it sends a message to the main thread, which will process the message asynchronously, meaning it will continue with other tasks while waiting for the main thread to be available.

2. **Function Invocation:** The message carries the function (`f`) you want to execute on the main thread, along with any parameters (`args`) you want to pass to it.

3. **Synchronous Execution (if applicable):**  If `voltmx.runOnMainThread` is called within a JavaScript function that's already running on the main thread, then the function passed to `voltmx.runOnMainThread` will execute synchronously. This means it will be executed immediately, without any message queuing or asynchronous processing.

**Syntax:**

```javascript
voltmx.runOnMainThread(f, args);
```

**Parameters:**

* **f (Function)**: The function that you want to execute on the main thread. This is a mandatory parameter.
* **args (Array, optional)**: An array of arguments that you want to pass to the function `f`.

**Example:**

```javascript
function myFunctionOnMain() {
  console.log(""This function is running on the main thread!"");
}

// Execute the myFunctionOnMain function on the main thread
voltmx.runOnMainThread(myFunctionOnMain); 
```

**Note:** Be mindful of using `voltmx.runOnMainThread` when dealing with UI updates or interactions, as these actions should usually be performed on the main thread to avoid UI inconsistencies.

2024-08-09 08:00:22.968243 UTC,how to rotate an image in voltmx iris,"Volt MX Iris doesn't have a built-in function specifically to rotate an image. However, you can achieve image rotation by using the `voltmx.image.createImage` function, which allows you to manipulate image data. Here's a general approach:

1. **Load the Image:**
   - Use the `voltmx.image.createImage` function to load the image you want to rotate. For example, you might load it from the device's storage, a network URL, or from within your app's bundle.

2. **Rotate the Image:**
   - You'll need to use a third-party library or a native code plugin to handle the actual image rotation. Popular image processing libraries often provide functions for rotating images.
   * **Example using a third-party library (assuming you're using a library that provides a `rotate` function):**
     ```javascript
     // Load the image
     var imageObj = voltmx.image.createImage(""myImageFile.jpg"");

     // Rotate the image by 90 degrees
     var rotatedImageObj = imageLibrary.rotate(imageObj, 90); 

     // You can now use the rotatedImageObj directly or save it to a file 
     ```

3. **Display the Rotated Image:**
   - After rotating the image, you can use the `src` property of an Image widget to display the rotated image.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Third-Party Libraries:**  Explore image processing libraries compatible with Volt MX Iris. Refer to documentation on how to integrate and use these libraries within your project.
* **Native Code Plugins:**  If you need more control or specific image manipulation features, consider using native code plugins (iOS or Android).
* **Performance:**  Be mindful of performance implications when rotating images, especially for large images. Explore optimizations like caching and efficient processing methods.

Remember, the specific implementation will depend on your chosen library or plugin. For detailed instructions, refer to the library's documentation.

2024-08-09 08:02:41.123172 UTC,how to write images to gallery using voltmx iris,"To write an image to the device's gallery using Volt MX Iris, you need to use the `voltmx.image.createImage` API to create an Image object from the raw bytes of the image. Then, you can use the `voltmx.image.createImageFromSnapShot` API to assign the Image object to an Image widget. Finally, save the image to the gallery using the device's native functionality. 

Here's a procedural breakdown and an example:

**Procedure:**

1. **Capture the image:**
   - Use `voltmx.camera.captureImage` to capture an image from the device's camera. This will provide you with the raw bytes of the captured image.
2. **Create the Image object:**
   - Utilize `voltmx.image.createImage(rawBytes)` to create an Image object from the raw bytes obtained in step 1.
3. **Save the image to the gallery:**
   - You'll need to use a native code plugin or a third-party library to handle the image saving operation to the device's photo gallery. 
     - **Example using a library:**  Assume you're using a library called `imageLibrary` (replace with the actual library).  
       ```javascript
       // After capturing the image and creating the Image object
       imageLibrary.saveImageToGallery(imageObj); 
       ```
4. **Handle Permissions:**
   - Ensure your app has the necessary permissions (e.g., WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) to write to the device's storage. Add the permission to your Android Manifest file.

**Example Code:**

```javascript
// Assuming you're using a library called imageLibrary
// Add this permission to your Android Manifest file:
// <uses-permission android:name=""android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE""/> 
voltmx.camera.captureImage(
  function(successCallback) {
    // Success callback: rawBytes is the captured image
    var rawBytes = successCallback; 
    
    // Create an Image object from the raw bytes
    var imageObj = voltmx.image.createImage(rawBytes);

    // Save the image to the device's gallery
    imageLibrary.saveImageToGallery(imageObj);
  },
  function(errorCallback) {
    // Error callback: handle any errors during image capture
    console.log(""Error while capturing image: "" + errorCallback);
  },
  {
    width: 1080, 
    height: 1920,
    encode: voltmx.image.ENCODE_JPEG
  }
);
```

**Key Considerations:**

* **Permissions:** Make sure you have all the necessary permissions to access the device's camera and storage.
* **Library Integration:**  You'll likely need to integrate a suitable third-party library or plugin that provides functionality for saving images to the gallery. Ensure you follow the documentation of your selected library for the correct implementation. 
* **Handling Errors:**  Always include appropriate error handling to gracefully manage scenarios where image capturing or saving fails.

2024-08-09 08:14:04.566841 UTC,how to create an animation for an image in iris,"You can create animations for images in Volt MX Iris using the `voltmx.animation.animate` function. This function allows you to animate the position, scaling, rotation, opacity, or other properties of a widget, including Image widgets. 

Here's a general approach:

1. **Import the necessary files:**
   ```javascript
   var kony = require(""kony/ui"");
   var voltmx = require(""voltmx/runtime"");
   ```

2. **Get a reference to the Image widget:**
   ```javascript
   var myImage = kony.ui.getWidget(""myImageId""); 
   ```

3. **Define the animation properties:**  This involves setting the animation's duration (in milliseconds), easing function, and the  target properties of the image.

   ```javascript
   var animationProps = {
       duration: 2000,  // Duration in milliseconds
       easing: voltmx.animation.EASE_CUBIC_OUT,  //  Choose an easing function. 
       properties: {
           //  Define target properties: Example - Scale
           transform: voltmx.animation.TRANS_SCALE,
           scaleX: 1.5,  //  Scale the width by 1.5
           scaleY: 1.5,  //  Scale the height by 1.5
       },
   };
   ```

4. **Call the `voltmx.animation.animate` function:**  This function executes the animation.

   ```javascript
   voltmx.animation.animate(myImage, animationProps); 
   ```

**Example:**  This example rotates an image by 360 degrees clockwise. 

```javascript
var myImage = kony.ui.getWidget(""myImageId""); 

// Define the animation properties
var animationProps = {
    duration: 2000, // Duration in milliseconds
    easing: voltmx.animation.EASE_CUBIC_OUT, //  Easing function 
    properties: {
        transform: voltmx.animation.TRANS_ROTATE,  //  Type of transformation - Rotation
        angle: 360,    //  Rotation angle in degrees
    },
};

// Execute the animation
voltmx.animation.animate(myImage, animationProps); 
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Easing Functions:**  You can select from various easing functions using constants like `voltmx.animation.EASE_LINEAR_OUT`, `voltmx.animation.EASE_SIN_IN`, `voltmx.animation.EASE_CUBIC_IN_OUT`, and others. Experiment with different easing functions to create the desired animation effect.
* **Platform Compatibility:** Be aware that certain animation features and easing functions might have platform-specific behaviors. Consult the Volt MX Iris documentation for detailed compatibility information.
* **User Experience:**  Avoid creating jarring or disorienting animations. Use animation smoothly and in a way that complements the overall user experience of your application.

4. **List or Fetch Media:**  Once you have the paths to the media folders, you can use the file system functions to list the available files or fetch specific files based on their names or other criteria.

**Example Snippet (Android):**

```javascript
// Import the necessary module
const file = require('com.konylabs.nativefunction.file');

// Request permission (if necessary)
// ... (see previous responses for requesting permissions)

// Get path to the device's media directory
const mediaPath = file.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory('Pictures');  

// List files in the Pictures folder
file.listFiles(mediaPath).then(files => {
    console.log(files); // Output the list of media files
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(""Error accessing media files:"", error);
});

2024-08-09 07:53:01.227959 UTC,How to create an animation to a widget,"To create an animation to a widget in Iris, you can use the built-in animation functionalities provided by the platform. Here are some key options: 

1. **Choose a Container:** Place your widget within a suitable container, such as a `FlexForm`, `Flex Container`, or `Flex Scroll Container`. 

2. **Select the Widget:** Identify the widget you want to animate. This could be any widget like a button, label, image, or custom component. 

3. **Define Animation Properties:** Determine the type of animation and the properties you want to change. For example:
    * **Transformation:** Animate the widget's position (move it around the container).
    * **Rotation:** Rotate the widget around its center (spin it).
    * **Scaling:** Change the widget's size (make it larger or smaller).
    * **Opacity:** Adjust the widget's transparency (fade it in or out).

4. **Use the Animation APIs:** Volt MX Iris provides several APIs for animations:
    * **voltmx.ui.animation.animate:** For basic animations like showing, hiding, zooming, and rotating.
    * **voltmx.ui.animation.createAnimation:** Create a more complex animation, with control over timing, easing functions, and more.

5. **Create Animation Sequences (Optional):** Stitch together multiple animations to create complex sequences, where each animation triggers when the previous one ends.

6. **Control the Animation:** Decide how the animation will be triggered:
    * **On User Action:** Trigger animation when a button is clicked, a touch event occurs, or a specific condition is met (e.g., on form load).
    * **Manually:** Initiate animation using an API call.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **2D vs. 3D Animations:** Volt MX Iris supports both 2D and 3D animations. The availability of 3D animations varies depending on the platform (iOS, SPA).
* **Optimization:** Keep animations simple when dealing with large or complex widgets to ensure smooth performance.
* **Documentation:** Refer to the Volt MX Iris documentation for in-depth guidance and code examples. 

**Code Example (Basic Animation):**

```javascript
// Get a reference to the widget
var widgetToAnimate = voltmx.ui.getWidget(""WidgetId""); 

// Define animation properties
var animationProperties = {
    ""100"": {
        ""left"": ""200"",
        ""top"": ""150"" 
    }
};

// Create animation object
var animation = voltmx.ui.animation.createAnimation(animationProperties, 0.5, 0, voltmx.ui.animation.easeInOut);

// Animate the widget
widgetToAnimate.animate(animation);
```

This example moves the widget with `WidgetId` to a position 200 pixels to the right and 150 pixels downwards over a duration of 0.5 seconds. The `easeInOut` easing function creates a smooth transition.

Remember to substitute `WidgetId`, animation properties, and duration according to your needs. Consult the official documentation for more detailed examples and to explore the full capabilities of Volt MX Iris's animation APIs.

This is essential for ensuring that the NFI functions correctly within your application.

**Here's a breakdown of the process:**

1. **Adding the Third-Party NFI:** The first step is to physically add the third-party NFI to your Iris project. This might involve importing the NFI from a specific source or copying the relevant files directly into your project. The exact method will depend on the NFI's packaging and distribution format.

2. **Linking to the VoltMXJS Target:** Once the NFI files are in your project, you need to link them to the VoltMXJS target. This establishes the connection between the NFI and the VoltMXJS environment, allowing your application code to utilize the NFI's functionalities.

3. **Addressing System Framework Dependencies:**  Many third-party NFIs rely on system frameworks provided by the operating system. For example, an NFI that uses the `UIKit` framework on iOS requires the UIKit framework to be linked to your project. This is generally done in the project settings where you can add or exclude system frameworks.  This step is crucial for resolving issues that might arise due to missing framework symbols.

4. **Verify Dependencies:** After incorporating the NFI, it's crucial to verify that all dependencies are correctly linked and configured. This might involve building your project and inspecting any errors or warnings.  
    
**For instance, let's say you're incorporating the AlertView NFI that depends on UIKit:**

- Add the AlertView NFI to your project.
- Link the NFI to your VoltMXJS target.
- If you encounter build errors related to UIKit symbols, navigate to your Xcode project's settings and add the UIKit framework to the list of system frameworks.

To invoke services in VoltMX Iris, typically, you would use JavaScript functions within your application code. The exact code depends on the specific service, its parameters, and the actions you want to perform (e.g., authentication, data retrieval, or service invocation).

For example, if you have an Identity service for authentication, you might use a function like this:

```javascript
// Assuming the identity service is named 'MyIdentityService'
function authenticateUser() {
  // Trigger the authentication process using the Identity service
  voltmx.app.invokeService(
    'MyIdentityService', // Service name
    'login', // Service operation
    { username: 'your_username', password: 'your_password' }, // Input parameters
    successCallback, // Function to handle successful authentication
    errorCallback // Function to handle errors during authentication
  );
}

// Callback function for successful authentication
function successCallback(response) {
  // Process the authentication response (e.g., store session information)
  console.log(""Authentication successful:"", response);
}

// Callback function for errors during authentication
function errorCallback(error) {
  // Handle the error
  console.error(""Authentication error:"", error);
}
```

Similarly, you would use JavaScript functions to interact with Integration services. 

**Remember:** 

* **Service Name:** Replace `""MyIdentityService""` with the actual name of your Identity service in Iris.
* **Service Operation:** `""login""` in the example represents a service operation. You'll need to substitute it with the appropriate operation for your Identity service.
* **Parameters:** The object `{ username: 'your_username', password: 'your_password' }` contains input parameters for the service. Adjust these based on your service's requirements.
* **Callback Functions:** `successCallback` and `errorCallback` are placeholder functions. Implement them to handle success or failure scenarios appropriately.

2024-08-09 05:24:13.798140 UTC,Can Iris be integrated to any other backend system?,"Yes, you can integrate Iris with a wide range of backend systems using its Data Panel feature. This feature enables you to seamlessly connect your UI elements in your Volt MX Iris application to backend data services with minimal code, or even no code at all. 

Think of it as a bridge between your frontend and backend.  The Data Panel simplifies the process of connecting to backends like databases, REST APIs, and other data sources. 

For more details about integrating Iris with different backend systems, you should refer to the provided source document for ""How to Use an Existing Integration Service.""

2024-08-09 08:20:08.233156 UTC,"What is the difference between ""Build and Publish Native"" and ""Build and Preview"" in Iris ??","The ""Build and Publish Native"" option in Iris refers to building and publishing your native mobile application (Android or iOS) to the Enterprise App Store (EAS) in Foundry. The process involves generating the AAB/APK file using the cloud build service and then publishing it to the EAS. This means that the entire build and publishing process occurs on the cloud.

On the other hand, ""Build and Preview"" option serves as a way to test your app without performing a full build and publishing process.  This option allows you to test your web app in ""Live Preview mode"", which provides a quick and convenient way to see changes in your app and debug your code.  This also lets you inspect the behavior of your app before committing to a full build.

Here's a summary of the differences between ""Build and Publish Native"" and ""Build and Preview"" in Iris:

| Feature | ""Build and Publish Native"" | ""Build and Preview"" |
|---|---|---|
| **Build Process** | Cloud build service | No full build required |
| **Publish Process** | Publishes to EAS in Foundry | Does not publish |
| **Platform** | Native mobile app (Android/iOS) | Web app |
| **Purpose** | Deploying a production-ready app | Testing and debugging |

The option you choose depends on your current needs and goals. For testing your web app, ""Build and Preview"" is the ideal option. However,  for deploying a final version of your mobile app, ""Build and Publish Native"" is essential for making your application available to users via the Enterprise App Store.

It's important to note that the ""Build and Publish Native"" option is not available when Iris is connected to an on-premises Foundry instance. In such cases, you would need to select ""Build Native Local"" and manually upload the generated native binaries to Foundry using the `binary-upload MFCLI` command with the `--upgradable` parameter. This approach allows you to set upgrade policies for your native apps within the on-premises Foundry environment.

2024-08-09 05:28:49.799330 UTC,provide sample code for dynamic data allocation to segment,"To dynamically allocate data to a segment in Volt MX Iris, you can leverage the Data Panel feature. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Create a Data Service:** Use the Data Panel to connect your application to a backend data service. This service will be the source of your dynamic data. 
2. **Set Up Data Panel:** Within the Data Panel, define a service operation that fetches data from your chosen backend service. 
3. **Bind Data to Segment:** In your Iris application, link the data retrieved by the service operation to the segment widget. You can do this by setting the segment's ""Master Data"" property to the output of your service operation.
4. **Define Row Template:** Design a row template that outlines the structure of each segment row. Place widgets within a Flex Container within the template and assign it to the segment. This will ensure consistent display for every row.
5. **Preview and Test:** Use the Iris application preview to visualize the data dynamically populating the segment. Ensure the data integration and display work as expected.

**Remember:**  Consult the Volt MX Iris documentation ([https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/C_UsingComponents.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/C_UsingComponents.html)) for more detailed information on data binding and other advanced concepts.

2024-08-09 10:13:59.688825 UTC,how can Implement the search routes for map widget in Volt MX Iris ?,"Volt MX Iris does not provide a built-in search feature for map widgets or their child widgets like markers or callouts. Therefore, you can't directly implement the search routes for map widgets as you described. 

However, you can achieve similar functionality by using the **getPageObjects** method with specific filters. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify the Map Widget:** Make sure you have a Map widget in your Volt MX Iris application. This can be achieved using the visual editor or programmatically.
2. **Create a Search Filter:**  
    - Use the `getPageObjects` method to search for the Map widget or its specific child widgets. 
    - Define appropriate filters focusing on desired properties like coordinates, labels, addresses, or other relevant information for your search function.
    - Use the `property` and `value` parameters to specify the exact property and value you're looking for in the filter.
    - Consider using `caseSensitive` parameter if required.
3. **Implement Search Logic:**
    - Based on the results obtained from the `getPageObjects` method, filter the results to identify the relevant widgets (markers, callouts) based on your search criteria.
    - Implement a mechanism to present the results to the user. For example, you can create a new list to showcase the available routes or highlight them on the map.

**Example:**

This example assumes you have markers on the map, and you want to filter markers with a specific label. 

```javascript
// Search for markers with a specific label
voltmx.automation.getPageObjects({
    ""filters"": [
        {
            ""property"": ""text"", 
            ""value"": ""Route 1"", 
            ""caseSensitive"": true 
        }
    ]
}, function(object) {
    // Process the returned list of widgets
    // Handle the filtered markers based on your preference, e.g., 
    // highlight the route on the map or display a list of matches 
});
```

**Note:** This example focuses on retrieving the markers based on their ""text"" property. You can modify the `property` to match your specific use case and adapt the code to your application logic.

While Volt MX Iris may not have direct search methods specific to map widgets, using the `getPageObjects` method with appropriate filtering can provide a workaround to implement search for routes and other map features. Remember to tailor the code and filter parameters based on your map widget's structure and the desired search criteria.

2024-08-09 10:29:11.209699 UTC,How can I use deeplinking feature in an application through Volt MX Iris ?,"Unfortunately, the provided context doesn't directly cover the topic of ""deeplinking"" within Volt MX Iris. However, I can provide you with some general guidance based on common practices and industry standards for deep linking:

Deep linking is a powerful feature for mobile applications, allowing you to direct users to specific content or actions within your app. While Volt MX Iris might not have explicit in-built support for deep linking, you can achieve this functionality using a combination of Volt MX Iris's capabilities and standard deep linking practices:

**Steps to Implement Deep Linking:**

1. **Define Unique URLs:**  Create unique, well-structured URLs that correspond to specific content or actions within your app. These URLs are the ""deep links"".  
2. **Handle URL Schemes:**  Set up a mechanism to handle these deep links. This involves registering a unique URL scheme for your app (e.g., `myapp://` or similar). 
3. **Implement a Deep Linking Handler:**  Use the Volt MX Iris Native Function API to create a custom handler that intercepts incoming deep links. This handler should:
    *  Parse the URL and extract the relevant information (e.g., content ID, action type).
    *  Navigate to the appropriate section of your app based on the parsed URL information.
4. **Integrate with External Systems:** If you want to deep link from other platforms (like emails, websites), ensure you create deep links that are compatible with the platform and integrate with your app's deep linking handler.

**Additional Resources:**

* **Android Deep Linking:** For Android-specific guidance: [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/app-links](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/app-links)
* **iOS Universal Links:** For iOS specific guidance: [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html)

**Example Implementation (Concept):**

```javascript  // Assuming you're using a custom URL scheme ""myapp://""
voltmx.nativefunction.registerNativeFunction(""handleDeepLink"", function(url) {
    // Extract the relevant information from the URL, for example, using a regular expression
    var contentId = extractContentIdFromUrl(url); 
    
    // Navigate to the corresponding content in your Volt MX Iris app
    navigateToContent(contentId);

    // Return success to the deep link call
    return true; 
});

function extractContentIdFromUrl(url) {
    // Your code to extract the content ID from the deep link URL 
}

function navigateToContent(contentId) {
    // Your Volt MX Iris code to navigate to the appropriate content or section based on the contentId
}
```

Remember to adapt this example to your specific app's logic and URL structures. 

 Implementing deep linking requires a thoughtful strategy and careful integration with Volt MX Iris's capabilities.  Always consider security best practices when handling deep links and user data.

2024-08-09 12:38:13.972873 UTC,how to protect ios application,"Protecting your iOS application goes beyond just code. Here's a multi-layered approach you should consider:

**1. Runtime Permissions:**

   * **iOS 8.0 and above:** iOS enforces runtime permissions for accessing sensitive resources like camera, microphone, contacts, location, etc.
   * **First-Time Request:**  When your app needs a permission, request it the first time it launches.
   * **User Choices:**
      * **Grant:** The user can allow your app access.
      * **Deny:**  The app *cannot* re-request this permission within the app. 
      * **Re-Enabling:** The user must manually grant access through the device's settings.
   * **Example:**  Say your app needs to access the camera.  Only request camera access on the first launch. If the user denies, you'll need to guide them to the device settings to enable it if they change their mind.

**2. Code Security:**

   * **Code Obfuscation:** This makes it harder for others to reverse engineer your code, protecting your intellectual property.
   * **Secure APIs:**  Use secure APIs to communicate with backend servers.
   * **Input Validation:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection.
   * **Code Signing:** Ensure your app is signed correctly with a certificate to help establish authenticity.

**3. App Store Policies:**

   * **Apple's Guidelines:**  Adhere to Apple's strict App Store guidelines. This includes rules for data privacy, security, and content.
   * **Regular Updates:**  Patch security vulnerabilities promptly. Apple's review process can take time, making keeping your app up-to-date crucial.

**4. Data Protection:**

   * **Encryption:**  Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.
   * **Data Access Control:** Implement data access controls within your app to limit who sees what.
   * **Privacy Policy:**  Be transparent about how you collect, use, and store user data in a clear privacy policy.

**5. Advanced Security:**

   * **Sandboxing:** iOS apps operate in a limited environment called a sandbox.  This helps compartmentalize apps and minimize the impact of breaches.
   * **Third-Party Libraries:** Be wary of potentially insecure third-party libraries. Carefully vet any such libraries and prioritize security.

**Key Resources:**

* **Apple Developer Documentation:**  [https://developer.apple.com/documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation)
* **iOS Security Guide:**  [https://developer.apple.com/security](https://developer.apple.com/security)

**Remember:** Security is an ongoing process. Be diligent in implementing the latest security practices and regularly review your app's security posture.

2024-08-09 09:53:22.650941 UTC,"Difference between self and this, voltmx?","In VoltMX JavaScript, `this` and `self` are not interchangeable.

**`this`** refers to the object that is currently executing the code within a function.  This can be different depending on how the function is called.  In the context of VoltMX event callbacks or event handlers, `this` will always refer to the widget that triggered the event. 

**`self`** is not a standard JavaScript keyword and is not defined within the VoltMX framework.  It's possible you may be referring to a custom variable or function you've defined in your code.

It's important to note that the behavior of `this` can be complex and can vary between different JavaScript environments.

2024-08-09 09:57:36.914583 UTC,Create a form to display location and current temperature. Also write the controller code for this functionality.,"Let's create a form to display location and current temperature using VoltMX. We'll use the VoltMX Navigation object to pass data between forms. 

**Form Design:**

1. **Create a new form:**  In VoltMX Studio, create a new form (let's call it ""frmLocation"") and add two widgets:
    * **Label Widget:** This will display the location.
    * **Label Widget:** This will display the current temperature. 

2. **Configure the widgets:** 
    * **Location Label:** Set the widget's `text` property to ""Location: ""  (This will be replaced with the actual location data later).
    * **Temperature Label:** Set the widget's `text` property to ""Temperature: "" (This will be replaced with the actual temperature data later). 

**Form Controller Code (`frmLocation.js`):**

```javascript
function frmLocation_postshow() {
  // Fetch location data (replace with your implementation)
  var location = ""unknown""; // Example: Replace with actual city or address
  var temperature = ""unknown""; // Example: Replace with actual temperature

  // Update the widgets with data
  this.view.lblLocation.text = ""Location: "" + location;
  this.view.lblTemperature.text = ""Temperature: "" + temperature; 
}
```

**Explanation:**

*  **`frmLocation_postshow()`:** This function is executed when the form becomes visible.
*  **`this.view.lblLocation` and `this.view.lblTemperature`:**  These access the widgets you created in the form.
* **`location` and `temperature` variables:**  Replace the placeholder values ( ""unknown"" ) with your actual data-fetching logic. (See below for suggestions). 

**Integrating with Data from another Form (Example):**

1.  **Creating the Source Form:** Make another form (e.g., ""frm1"") with an input field for users to enter their location. 
2.  **Passing Data between Forms:**  
    * **frm1:**  Set up a button with an `onClick` event that navigates to `frmLocation` using the VoltMX Navigation Object. Use code similar to the following:
      ```javascript
       function btnNavigate_onClick() {
        // Get data from the input field (replace with your input widget)
        var locationInput = this.view.txtLocation.text;

        var navigationObject = new voltmx.mvc.Navigation(); 
        navigationObject.navigate(frmLocation, {location: locationInput});
       }
      ```
    * **frmLocation:**  In the `frmLocation_postshow()` function, access the passed data using `this.view.navigator.data.location`. You can then use this data to fetch the actual temperature using your chosen weather API or other data source.

**Fetching Location Data:**

* **Using the Browser's Geolocation API:** For getting the user's location (if allowed), you'll need to use the Geolocation API in JavaScript  ([https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API): [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)). 
* **Using a Location API:** You can use external Location APIs (e.g., Google Maps Geocoding API) to obtain coordinates or addresses. 

**Fetching Temperature Data:**

* **Using Weather APIs:** Use a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI.com) to fetch the temperature based on the location you obtained. 

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling in your `postshow` and data fetching functions to address potential issues like network errors or invalid data.
* **User Experience:**  Provide feedback to the user as the location and temperature data is being fetched (e.g., a loading indicator).
* **API Keys:** If using a weather API, make sure to obtain and use API keys securely.

By combining these steps, you can create a form that displays location and temperature in your VoltMX application.

2024-08-09 09:58:39.002212 UTC,"What are native function APIs in iris, and how do you integrate them into your projects?","Native Function APIs (NFIs) in VoltMX Iris are JavaScript wrappers for native iOS and Android APIs. They provide access to specific functionalities not readily available through generic JavaScript methods. 

Essentially, NFIs allow you to call native iOS (Objective-C) or Android functions directly from your JavaScript code within a VoltMX Iris application. 

Here's a step-by-step guide on integrating NFIs into your VoltMX Iris project:

1. **Add Native Function Frameworks and Packages:**
    - Navigate to the ""Project Settings"" of your VoltMX Iris project. 
    - Select the ""Self Sufficient Module"" tab.
    - Check the boxes corresponding to the NFIs you want to use, which will be displayed under the relevant platform (iOS or Android).
    - Click ""Finish.""

2. **Access and Utilize the NFI's Functionality:**
    -  Import the necessary NFI classes into your JavaScript module:

        ```javascript
        // In your JavaScript module
        var Camera = require('com.sample.camera'); // Assuming 'com.sample.camera' is your NFI
        ```

    - Instantiate the class (if applicable):

        ```javascript
        var camera = new Camera();
        ```

    - Call methods of the NFI:

        ```javascript
        camera.startCamera(); // Assuming 'startCamera' is a method in your NFI
        ```

3. **Build and Deploy:**
    - Build your VoltMX Iris application as usual.
    - Deploy it to a device or an emulator. 

**Key Point:** You will need to have a good understanding of the native iOS or Android APIs that the NFI is wrapping.  Refer to the API documentation provided by Apple and Google for details on how to use these APIs effectively. 

**Note**: Remember that while NFIs provide powerful access to native functionalities, they can impact platform independence. If your application relies heavily on NFIs, ensure they are well-documented and tested to maintain your application's stability across platforms.

2024-08-09 10:08:05.484410 UTC,Can we create a segment dynamically in irs?,"The provided context doesn't explicitly mention creating segments dynamically in Iris.  It primarily focuses on how to use and design segments within the user interface. 

However, you can control the visibility of segments and their associated components programmatically using JavaScript.  This allows for dynamic behavior to show or hide certain sections of the UI based on user actions or data conditions. 

Here's a general approach:

1. **Create Segments in Design Time:** Design your segments within the Iris canvas as you normally would, using the visual editor and assigning their necessary properties.

2. **Assign IDs to Segments:** Give each segment a unique ID for easy reference in your JavaScript code.  

3. **Use JavaScript for Dynamic Control:** Within your Iris application's JavaScript code, you can access and manipulate the segments' visibility using VoltMX Iris API functions.

   ```javascript
   // Assuming you have a segment with the ID ""dynamicSegment""
   const segmentElement = kony.ui.getWidgetById(""dynamicSegment"");

   // Make the segment visible
   segmentElement.setVisibility(true); 

   // Make the segment hidden
   segmentElement.setVisibility(false);

   // Alternatively, you could use ""segmentElement.isVisible()"" to check its current state.
  ```

4. **Trigger Logic:** Base the visibility changes on events, data changes, or any relevant logic in your application. 

This technique provides a way to dynamically control what segments are displayed in your Iris application, allowing you to create interactive UI experiences.

Remember that this is a general approach, and specific implementations may vary based on your project requirements.  It's crucial to refer to the official VoltMX Iris documentation for detailed API usage and examples that fit your application's context.

2024-08-09 09:04:42.711019 UTC,How to design Desktop Native Apps using Iris?,"You can design Desktop Native Applications using Volt MX Iris by taking advantage of web applications running within the Electron environment.  Volt MX Iris gives you the ability to create desktop apps that can integrate with Windows and macOS platforms.  This involves web-based techniques but also lets you interact with the desktop operating system through APIs and mechanisms provided by Volt MX. 

Here’s a breakdown of the significant steps involved: 

1. **Design your web application in Iris**.  Use the Iris drag-and-drop interface and components to design the layout, UI, and core functionality of the application. 
2. **Leverage Electron for desktop integration**.  Iris primarily focuses on mobile app development, but you can utilize the Electron framework for desktop development.  Electron essentially packages your web app within a desktop environment, using Node.js for access to desktop-specific features. 
3. **Build and Package Your Application**.  After designing the application, use Volt MX Iris’s tools to build and package it as a web app for the Electron environment.  This will produce a package that includes your web app and the Electron framework.  
4. **Integrate with the desktop environment (Optional)**. While not directly supported by the documentation, it may be possible to call or interact with native desktop functions.  You can implement bridge code using the exposed APIs by the framework.  For example, you may use a separate module, generally written in separate programming languages for both operating systems, to communicate with the Electron environment.  This enables you to achieve features that directly involve the desktop. 
5. **Test and Deploy**. The resulting package will need to be tested and built for the specific desktop operating system.  Test the app on target platforms for proper functionality and interoperability with the environment. 

**Important Considerations:**

*   **MVC Architecture:** Volt MX applications are based on MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. Ensure that your application design adheres to this pattern.
*   **Access Rights Considerations:** When developing Desktop Native apps, you need to understand platform-specific access rights and permissions for interacting with the desktop environment.
*   **Platform-Specific APIs:** When integrating with the desktop environment, you may need to utilize separate libraries or APIs for Windows and macOS due to their differences.  

**Additional Resources**:

*   **Electron Framework Documentation:** Consult the documentation for the Electron framework. While the focus is on web app packaging, you’ll find numerous resources and tutorials about integrating it.
*   **Volt MX Documentation:** Review the Volt MX documentation, particularly its section on Native Function APIs. This will give you insights into how to utilize native functionality for interfacing with desktop environments. Research any guides on using Electron with Volt MX Iris (if available).



**Note**: Volt MX Iris lacks explicit support for Desktop Native development, but the approach mentioned earlier combined with the resources available should enable you to develop the apps you desire.  Remember, this approach requires a deeper understanding of web development principles, working with hybrid frameworks like Electron, and navigating the specifics of both the web application environment and the desktop operating system.

To create a CollectionView widget in Iris, you'll need to use JavaScript within your app's controller. Here's a general outline:

1. **Import the necessary module:**
   ```javascript 
   var CollectionView = require('com.kony.ui.CollectionView');
   ```

2. **Create a CollectionView instance:** 
   ```javascript
   var collectionView = new CollectionView({
       ""id"": ""CollectionView0"", // Give your widget a unique ID
       ""isVisible"": true, // Set visibility to true if you want it visible initially
       ""left"": ""0dp"", // Position the widget (adjust as needed)
       ""top"": ""0dp"", // Position the widget (adjust as needed)
       ""width"": ""100%"", // Set width of the widget 
       ""height"": ""100%"" // Set height of the widget
   });
   ```
   You can adjust the `id`, `left`, `top`, `width`, and `height` based on your app's layout and requirements.

3. **Define a template (optional):**  
   - You can create a template for the individual items within your CollectionView. This helps ensure a consistent look and feel. You can define the template using standard Iris UI elements. 
   - Refer to the VoltMX Iris User Guide for details on creating and configuring templates.

4. **Set the data source:**
   - Provide the data that the CollectionView will display. This can be an array of objects, a data service response, or any other data structure you're loading from your application.

5. **Attach the CollectionView to a view:** 
    -  Add it as a child of a Form or Segment template. 
    - For instance, you might use `form.addChild(collectionView);` to add it to a form. 

6. **Configure the CollectionView:**
   - **`dataManager`:** Set the data source for the CollectionView using the `setDataManager` method. 
   - **`dataField`:** Specify the field within your data source that holds the data to be displayed. 
   - **`template`:** Assign your predefined template (if you created one) to the CollectionView.
   - **`rowTemplate`:**  Set the template used to represent a single row in the CollectionView (typically, you would set `rowTemplate` to the `template` you have created).
   - **`sectionTemplate`:**  Define the template for a section header (if your data has sections). 

7. **Initialize the CollectionView:** 
   - You may need to trigger the `show` method once you have added it to your view and configured it. This will dynamically update the view with the data you configured.

**Example (simplified):**
```javascript
var CollectionView = require('com.kony.ui.CollectionView');

// ... (Other code)

var form = kony.application.getCurrentForm();

// Define the template (optional)
var myTemplate = new kony.ui.FlexContainer({
    id: ""myTemplate"",
    isVisible: true,
    layoutType: kony.flex.FLOW_HORIZONTAL,
    width: ""100%"",
    height: ""50dp"", // Adjust height as needed
    skin: ""CopyingFlexContainer0f8bb50d820e54e"",
    // ... (Add other UI elements within the template based on your data)
});

// Create the CollectionView instance
var collectionView = new CollectionView({
    ""id"": ""CollectionView0"", 
    ""isVisible"": true, 
    ""left"": ""0dp"", 
    ""top"": ""0dp"", 
    ""width"": ""100%"", 
    ""height"": ""100%""
});

// Data source example
var myData = [
    { ""name"": ""Item 1"", ""value"": ""Data 1"" },
    { ""name"": ""Item 2"", ""value"": ""Data 2"" },
    { ""name"": ""Item 3"", ""value"": ""Data 3"" }
];

// Set the CollectionView properties
collectionView.setDataManager(myData);
collectionView.dataField = ""name""; // Assuming your data has a 'name' field
collectionView.template = myTemplate; // Assign your template (if you created one)
collectionView.rowTemplate = myTemplate; //  Use the defined template for the rows
// ... (Other configurations as needed)

// Add to the form
form.addChild(collectionView);

// Show the CollectionView
collectionView.show(); 
```

Remember to replace `// ... (Other code)` above with any relevant data fetching or initialization steps you need.

2024-08-09 10:25:45.650622 UTC,What is NFI and How to integrate an NFI in Iris project?,"NFI stands for **Native Function Interface**.  It is a powerful mechanism in Volt MX Iris that allows you to access native platform features and functionalities directly from your Iris application. This means you can leverage the native capabilities of iOS, Android, or Windows, enhancing your app's functionality.

Integrating an NFI in your Iris project involves the following steps:

1. **Identify and Obtain the NFI:** Determine the specific NFI you need based on the desired functionality. This might involve researching available NFIs from third-party providers or exploring built-in NFI options provided by Volt MX.
2. **Import the NFI into your Iris Project:**  Import the NFI into your Iris project, typically by adding it to the project directory or using a provided import mechanism. You may need to download or obtain the NFI from the provider or repository.
3. **Link to Dependent Frameworks:** If the NFI relies on additional system frameworks, ensure these frameworks are linked to your project.  This is often necessary for third-party NFIs to access the required native components.
4. **Create a Self-Sufficient Module (SSM):**  To utilize the NFI in your Iris application, create a Self-Sufficient Module (SSM). This module acts as a container for the NFI and defines the interface through which your application will interact with the native functionality.
5. **Define the Interface:**  Within the SSM, define the interface for interacting with the NFI. This involves specifying the methods, properties, and events that your Iris application can use to interact with the NFI.
6. **Use the NFI in your Iris Application:** Once the SSM is created, you can use the NFI as if it were a standard Iris widget.  You can access its methods, properties, and events through the SSM's interface, enabling you to integrate native functionality seamlessly into your application.

**For Example:**
Let's say you want to integrate the `AlertView` NFI (a hypothetical example) to display native platform alerts in your Iris application.  

1. **Obtain the AlertView NFI:** You would need to acquire the AlertView NFI, whether it's a pre-built component or a custom NFI you developed.
2. **Import to Iris Project:** You would import the AlertView NFI into your project, placing it in the appropriate directory.
3. **Link to Frameworks (if needed):**  If AlertView requires a framework like `UIKit`, you would add this framework to your project, ensuring it's linked correctly.
4. **Create an SSM:**  In Iris, create an SSM named something like 'AlertViewSSM.'
5. **Define the Interface:**  Within the SSM, define methods like `showAlert(title, message)` to abstract the interaction with the AlertView NFI.
6. **Utilize in Iris:**  In your Iris application, you could then use the following code to display an alert:
   ```javascript
   AlertViewSSM.showAlert('Information', 'This is a test alert');

1. **Create two forms:**  Make sure you have at least two forms in your project. For example, let's call them `frm1` and `frm2`. 

2. **Add a button to the first form (`frm1`):**  In the Design Studio, add a `Button` widget to the first form.

3. **Configure the button's `onClick` action:**  
    - Select the button widget in the Design Studio.
    - Go to **Properties > Action**.
    - Click **Edit** for the `onClick` event.
    - The **Action Editor** will appear.  

4. **Select the ""Navigate to Form"" action:**  
    - In the Action Editor, scroll through the list of actions on the left.
    - Find the **Navigation** section.
    - Click **Navigate to Form**. 

5. **Choose the target form (`frm2`)**  In the lower section of the Action Editor, select `frm2` as the form to be navigated to.

6. **Click OK:**  This will add the navigation action to the button, connecting it to the `frm2` form.

Now, when the button on `frm1` is clicked, the application will navigate to `frm2`. 

**Alternatively, you can use JavaScript to achieve the same result:**

```javascript
// In the controller for frm1 (frm1Controller.js)
kony.application.getCurrentForm().show(frm2); 
```

This JavaScript code will directly navigate to the `frm2` form when executed.

Remember that these are just basic examples. You can further  customize the navigation process with:

* **Data passing:**  Use the Action Editor or JavaScript to send data between the forms. 
* **Animations:**  Add animations to enhance the navigation experience.
* **Conditional navigation:**  Implement logic to navigate to different forms based on certain conditions or user actions.

For more detailed instructions and customization options, refer to the  Volt MX Iris User Guide. It provides a comprehensive guide to using the Action Editor, JavaScript, and other features for building your application's navigation structure.

However, it does cover the concept of Identity Services and custom endpoints, which are relevant to authentication.

Here's a breakdown of what we know from the documentation:

* **Identity Services:** Volt MX Foundry supports the use of Identity Services, which handle user authentication. These services can be based on various providers like Facebook, and you can configure them to use custom URLs.
* **Custom Endpoints:** When you publish a Volt MX Foundry app, it generates a custom endpoint URL specifically for your app, allowing the app to interact with the Foundry platform's identity system. 
* **Integration Services:**  You need to include integration services in your app to handle login and logout operations. These services will connect to the identity provider (like Instagram in your case).

**Missing Information for Instagram:**

The documentation provided doesn't specify the exact process for setting up Instagram authentication within Volt MX Foundry. To configure the callback URL for your Instagram identity setup, you'll likely need to refer to Instagram's developer documentation directly.

Here are some resources to help you get started:

* **Instagram Developer Documentation:** This is the primary source for understanding how to set up Instagram authentication and configure callbacks in your applications. [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram/)
* **Foundry User Guide:** While not directly related to Instagram, the Foundry User Guide provides information on creating custom endpoint URLs and configuring identity services.  [https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/FrontEndAPIURL_Objects.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/FrontEndAPIURL_Objects.html)

**Key Steps:**

1. **Register Your App with Instagram:** Create a new app on the Instagram developer platform. You'll need to provide basic information about your app and specify a valid callback URL. This is the URL that Instagram will redirect users back to after they successfully authenticate with Instagram.
2. **Configure Your Foundry App:** Configure your Foundry app for Instagram authentication. This likely involves setting up an integration service to handle login and logout using the Instagram API.
3. **Set the Callback URL:** In your Foundry app, configure the callback URL correctly to match the URL you provided during the Instagram app registration process.

**Remember:** The specific details for configuring the Instagram callback URL will depend on the current version of Volt MX Foundry you're using and the latest Instagram API documentation.

2024-08-09 18:00:43.058348 UTC,Could you check the browser widget documentation? i found a propert called customUserAgent there,"You are correct, there is a property called `customUserAgent` within the browser widget in VoltMX. You can set a custom User-Agent for your browser widget to control how your browser widget interacts with websites.

You can find the browser widget documentation at [https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXStudio/Invoking_Identity_Service_Iris.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXStudio/Invoking_Identity_Service_Iris.html), which explains this property in detail. 

**To set the customUserAgent property:**

1.  **Get a Reference to the Browser Widget:** In your VoltMX application, you'll need to have a reference to the browser widget object.  You can typically do this using the `voltmx.ui.Browser` constructor.

    ```javascript
    var browserWidget = new voltmx.ui.Browser();
    ```

2.  **Set the `customUserAgent` property:**  Set the desired custom User-Agent as a string value using the `customUserAgent` property of the browser widget instance.

    ```javascript
    browserWidget.customUserAgent = ""MyCustomApp/1.0 (Android)""; 
    ```

**Considerations:**

*   **Browser widget initialization:** Make sure you initialize the browser widget before setting its `customUserAgent` property.
*   **User-Agent string:**  Create a descriptive User-Agent string, including app name, version, platform, and other relevant information.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Assuming you have already created and initialized the browserWidget
// ... Initialize the browser widget (e.g., new voltmx.ui.Browser())

// Set the custom User-Agent
browserWidget.customUserAgent = ""MyVoltMXApp/1.0 (Android)""; 

// Now you can use the browserWidget to load URLs, and it will use the custom User-Agent you set
browserWidget.loadUrl(""https://www.example.com"");
```

This approach will give you control over the user agent specifically for the browser widget within your VoltMX application, which is different from managing the global user agent for the entire application through the Admin Console.

2024-08-09 18:03:20.357956 UTC,What are some of the disadvantages of voltmx?,"VoltMX, while offering a robust platform for mobile app development, does have certain drawbacks. Based on the information provided, here are some disadvantages:

* **Limited API Support:** There are certain APIs that are either not supported or have limited availability. For example, `voltmx.print()` does not work in Safari, and some APIs are not available for Single Page Applications (SPAs) or Desktop Web platforms. 
* **Limited Customization:** You might find certain limitations in customizing layouts for right-to-left languages (RTL), which might require manual adjustments, especially for complex forms or designs.
* **Dependence on Foundry:** VoltMX heavily relies on the VoltMX Foundry platform for back-end services. While this can be beneficial, it introduces a level of dependence on HCL Technologies' platform. This could potentially limit flexibility and options if you need to integrate with other back-end systems or if you prefer a more independent approach to app development.
* **Community and Documentation:** Although documentation exists, some specific aspects might be less comprehensive or readily accessible compared to other more mature development frameworks. This can result in a steeper learning curve, especially for complex tasks.

It's worth noting that VoltMX is constantly evolving, and new features and improvements are being introduced over time. However, these mentioned points are worth considering when evaluating if VoltMX aligns with your specific needs and project requirements.

2024-08-09 18:24:16.168463 UTC,"In a voltmx app, Can i send local notifications to users at exactly 7 AM everyday? Is this possible? if yes, can you give me the example code? If its not possible, explain me why it cant be done.","Yes, it's possible to send local notifications to users at exactly 7 AM every day using VoltMX. You'll need to use the `voltmx.localnotifications.create` function, but you'll need a workaround to schedule the notification at the desired time because VoltMX doesn't have a direct API for scheduling this.

Here's how you can approach it:

**1.  Background Service:**

   *   Create a background service within your VoltMX app.
   *   This service will run in the background and use the `setTimeout` function in JavaScript to schedule a delayed call to `voltmx.localnotifications.create` at a later time. This will schedule the notification for 7 AM the next day.
   *   You can use `setInterval` to repeat this daily.

**2.  Server-Side Integration:**

   *   Use a server-side component like Node.js or PHP to schedule notifications.
   *   Your VoltMX app would run a scheduled task that requests a notification from the server at 7 AM. The server would then trigger the notification using the VoltMX API.
   *   This approach is more reliable and better handles device background limitations.

**Example code (Background Service):**
```javascript
function scheduleNotification() {
  // Set the notification time (7 AM):
  var notificationTime = new Date();
  notificationTime.setHours(7, 0, 0, 0);

  var currentTime = new Date();
  var delay = notificationTime.getTime() - currentTime.getTime();

  function showNotification() {
    voltmx.localnotifications.create({
      notificationId: ""dailyNotification"",
      message: ""Good Morning!"",
      title: ""Daily Reminder"",
      // ... other notification settings
    });
  }

  setTimeout(showNotification, delay);  // Schedule with delay
  setInterval(scheduleNotification, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Repeat daily
}

// Call scheduleNotification when the application starts:
scheduleNotification();
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Background services:** Be mindful of background service limitations on Android and iOS. Make sure your service doesn't consume excessive resources.
* **Battery Optimization:**  On Android, optimize your application's background behavior to prevent the system from killing your service.
* **Permissions:**  Ensure your VoltMX app has the necessary permissions to send notifications (e.g., `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` on Android).

Remember, while this example demonstrates a background service approach, server-side integration might be a better option if you need more reliability and control over background behavior.

2024-08-09 14:23:40.758029 UTC,How to design the platform specific Forms in Iris?,"You can design platform-specific forms in Iris by utilizing the `kony.os.deviceInfo` object within your JavaScript code. This object provides information about the device's platform, allowing you to differentiate your form's design and functionality based on whether the user is on Android, iOS, or Mobile Web. 

Here's a breakdown of how you can implement this:

1. **Identify the Platform:** Use the `kony.os.deviceInfo.name` property to determine the current platform.

   ```javascript
   if (kony.os.deviceInfo.name === ""Android"") {
       // Execute code specific to Android
       // ...
   } else if (kony.os.deviceInfo.name === ""iOS"") {
       // Execute code specific to iOS
       // ...
   } else if (kony.os.deviceInfo.name === ""Mobile Web"") {
       // Execute code specific to Mobile Web
       // ...
   }
   ```

2. **Design Platform-Specific UI:** Within each conditional block, tailor your form's design based on the platform. This could involve:

   * **Using Platform-Specific Widgets:** Some widgets might be available only on specific platforms. For example, you might use a material design button on Android but a different button style on iOS.
   * **Customizing Layout:**  Adjust the layout of your form based on platform guidelines.  Android and iOS have different design principles, so ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms requires adapting your layout. 
   * **Styling:** Use platform-specific styling (e.g., using CSS classes) to maintain a consistent visual appearance with the overall platform aesthetic. 

3. **Implement Platform-Specific Functionality:**  Include platform-specific code within each conditional block. This allows you to dynamically change the behavior of your form based on the platform:

   * **Feature Availability:**  Some features might not be available on all platforms (like using native camera). You can use conditional logic to enable or disable such features based on the platform.
   * **API Calls:**  Implement platform-specific API calls that are tailored to each platform's capabilities.
   * **User Interaction:** Customize the user interaction based on the platform's touch-based interactions and user interface conventions.

Remember, you can utilize other properties within the `kony.os.deviceInfo` object (like `deviceInfo.version`, `deviceInfo.manufacturer`, or `deviceInfo.platform`)  to further refine your platform-specific code.

**Important Note:** Thoroughly test your form on each platform to ensure the design and functionality are optimal and consistent with the user experience expected on each platform.

For more in-depth information on the `kony.os.deviceInfo` object and designing platform-specific applications in Iris, refer to the documentation provided by HCL Technologies.

Hashing is a crucial cryptographic operation used to create unique fingerprints or digests of data, providing integrity and authenticity checks.

**Function Purpose:**

- This function takes a piece of data (e.g., a string, a password, or a file) as input and applies a specific hashing algorithm to it.
- The output is a fixed-length string of characters (the hash value) that's unique to the original data.
- If even a single bit changes in the original data, the resulting hash value will be completely different.

**Usage:**

1. **Data:**  This is the input data for which you want to generate a hash. It could be text, binary data, or other data formats.

2. **Algorithm:**  You need to specify the hashing algorithm to use. Volt MX Iris supports various algorithms, and the supported algorithms depend on the platform (Android, iOS, Windows). Here are some common algorithms:

   - **MD5:**  A widely used but now considered insecure hashing algorithm.
   - **SHA-1:**  Another widely used but increasingly considered insecure algorithm.
   - **SHA-256:**  A more secure and recommended hashing algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash.
   - **SHA-384:**  Generates a 384-bit hash for increased security.
   - **SHA-512:**  Produces a 512-bit hash, providing the highest level of security among the SHA algorithms.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Example for generating SHA-256 hash
var dataToHash = ""My confidential data"";
var algorithm = ""SHA-256"";

var hashValue = voltmx.crypto.createHash(dataToHash, algorithm);

// Print the hash value
console.log(""Hash value:"", hashValue);
```

**Security Considerations:**

- **Algorithm Selection:**  Choose algorithms that are considered secure and appropriate for your application's security requirements. Stronger algorithms (like SHA-256 or higher) generally provide better security.
- **Salt and Key Stretching:** For sensitive data like passwords, always use salt and key stretching techniques to enhance security and make it harder for attackers to guess or crack the hashed values.  Volt MX Iris provides a dedicated `createPBKDF2Key` function for this purpose.

**Additional Information:**

- Refer to the official Volt MX Iris documentation for details on supported algorithms, security best practices, and additional encryption functions available in the `voltmx.crypto` namespace.
- You can explore third-party cryptography libraries compatible with Volt MX Iris to expand your encryption options and obtain additional features if necessary.

4. **Call the `addGestureRecognizer` API:**  This method returns a gestureHandle which is a unique number representing the gesture that was added to the widget. This handle can be used to remove the gesture later.
   ```javascript
   var gestureHandle = voltmx.gestures.addGestureRecognizer(myWidget, gestureType, gestureCallback); 
   ```
   * **gestureCallback:**  This function will be invoked when the specified gesture is recognized. 
   * **gestureType:** This can be any of the gesture types like `voltmx.gestures.TAP`, `voltmx.gestures.SWIPE`, `voltmx.gestures.LONGPRESS`, `voltmx.gestures.PINCH`.  
   * **myWidget:**  This is the widget you want to add the gesture to.

5. **Implement the gesture callback function:** Define a function that will be executed when the gesture is recognized. 
    ```javascript
    function gestureCallback(widgetReference, gestureDetails) {
       //  Handle the specific gesture
       var gestureType = gestureDetails.type; 
       var location = gestureDetails.location || gestureDetails.startLocation;
       //  Process the gesture details and update the UI or perform actions as needed 
    }
    ```

**Example:**

```javascript
var myButton = kony.ui.getWidget(""myButtonId"");

// Define the TAP gesture
var gestureType = voltmx.gestures.TAP; 

function tapCallback(widgetReference, gestureDetails) {
  // Implement the logic to be executed when the button is tapped 
  console.log(""Button tapped: "", gestureDetails.location); //  Log the tap location
}

var gestureHandle = voltmx.gestures.addGestureRecognizer(myButton, gestureType, tapCallback);

//  You can remove the gesture later:
// voltmx.gestures.removeGestureRecognizer(gestureHandle); 
```

**Additional Recommendations:**

*   **Platform Considerations:** Be aware that certain gestures might have platform-specific behaviors. Consult the Volt MX Iris documentation for detailed platform compatibility information.
*   **User Experience:** Design gestures that are intuitive and easy to use. Consider the accessibility of gestures for users with disabilities.
*   **Documentation:** For complete details on available gesture types, parameters, and examples, refer to the official Volt MX Iris documentation. You can typically find it on the HCL Technologies website under the ""Iris"" > ""Volt Iris API Developers Guide"" section.

This approach will enable you to enhance your applications with gesture-based interactions.

         <external-path
             name=""external_files""
             path="".""/>
       </paths>
     </resources>
     ```

**5. Add Audio Permissions:**

   - Currently, the **Permissions** tab in VoltMX Iris doesn't directly offer a way to add audio permissions. However, the **Runtime Permissions API** allows you to dynamically request permissions at runtime. You can use the `voltmx.application.requestPermission` or `voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet` functions to request audio permissions (for example, `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`) in your Iris application's code.

**6. Test and Build:**

   - Save your changes and build your application.
   - Test your app on the device to verify that it can access the camera and audio functions after requesting the relevant permissions.

Remember that users will need to grant permissions to your application at runtime, so be sure to handle potential permission denials and provide helpful explanations within your application.

It simplifies connecting to backends like databases, REST APIs, and other data sources.  The Data Panel enables you to link backend data services to your application's UI elements using low-code to no-code methods. This means you can seamlessly connect your UI elements to your backend data with minimal coding or, in some cases, no coding at all.

For example, you could use the Data Panel to connect your app's user interface to a database to display and update data, or you could use it to connect to a REST API to fetch data and display it in your UI.

The Data Panel provides sample services that you can use to bind backend services to your apps and test your UI.

This limitation is highlighted in the documentation: ""Note: When you map the Request and Response nodes, the Mapping Editor prompts a warning message The Request/Response query for this verb uses custom XML mapping in Foundry. Hence dynamic UI generation and mapping is not supported in Iris."" 

However, you can achieve similar functionality through alternative methods:

* **Client-side Workflow:** Iris provides a client-side workflow editor that lets you design visual workflows using drag-and-drop actions. You can leverage this to create dynamic UI elements based on events and conditions, effectively mimicking dynamic UI generation.
* **Custom Code:** While Iris doesn't directly support dynamic mapping, you can write custom code to manipulate UI elements based on data received from your backend. For instance, you can use JavaScript to dynamically create or modify UI elements based on the data you retrieve from a backend service.
* **Conditional Rendering:**  You can use conditional rendering techniques to display different UI elements based on data received from your backend.  You can conditionally render UI components based on data received from the back-end. 

While direct mapping support isn't available in Volt MX Iris, the platform provides sufficient tools and flexibility to implement dynamic UI behavior using client-side workflow and custom code.  Remember, the key is to understand how Iris's features work together to create a truly dynamic user experience.

1. **Design your web app in Iris:** 
    - Start by designing your web application in Volt MX Iris. You can use Iris's drag-and-drop interface and components to create the layout, UI, and functionality of your web app.
2. **Generate the web app archive:**
    - Once your web app is designed, you need to generate the build artifacts to publish on Foundry. You can trigger the build process to generate the web archive files. 
3. **Locate the generated web archive:**
    - When the build is complete, you can find the generated web archives in your project's Volt MX Iris workspace within the `binaries` folder. 
4. **Publish the web app on Volt MX Foundry:**
    - You can then upload and publish your web app to Volt MX Foundry using the generated archives. This involves linking your Iris project to a Foundry app. You can create a new Foundry app or link it to an existing one.

These steps outline the general process of generating SPAs using Iris and publishing them to Foundry.

2024-08-09 05:30:58.380167 UTC,how to set value to label in controller,"You are trying to set the value of a Label widget within a component's controller without a contract. Due to the limitations of component architectures without contracts, directly accessing a specific row (like a label inside the component) using `this.view` isn't possible. 

Here's how you can approach this:

**1. Utilize the `setModel` Method:**

  * Pass the updated value from the controller to the component's model.
  * Within the component's `setModel` function, access the Label widget using its ID and set its text property.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Inside the component controller
function increment(){
    this.counter += 1;
    this.view.setModel({counter: this.counter});
}
// Inside the component's setModel function
function setModel(model){
    // Access the label using its ID
    this.view.CompLabel.text = model.counter;
}
```

**2. Employ a Custom Event:**

   * Define a custom event in the component and trigger it when the button is clicked.
   * Inside the component's controller, listen to this event and update the Label's text property accordingly.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Inside the component's controller
function increment(){
    this.counter += 1;
    // Trigger the custom 'updateLabel' event
    this.view.fireEvent(""updateLabel"", {counter: this.counter}); 
}
// Inside the component's 'updateLabel' event handler
function onUpdateLabel(event){
    // Access the label using its ID
    this.view.CompLabel.text = event.counter;
}
```

**Remember:** You'll need to ensure that the Label widget's ID is correctly specified within the component's HTML code or layout file.

**Recommendations:**

* The Volt MX Iris documentation ([https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/C_UsingComponents.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/C_UsingComponents.html)) provides excellent guidance on implementing components with contracts, which offer more robust control and data flow management. 
* Consider using a data binding approach, which allows you to connect data directly to UI elements for more efficient and elegant data handling.

2024-08-09 05:32:38.886964 UTC,how to use calander widget in controller,"While you can't directly manipulate the Calendar widget within a controller in Volt MX Iris, you can achieve similar results by interacting with it through events and data binding.

Since the Calendar widget is designed for user interaction, it's generally best to handle user selections through built-in events.

**Here's a breakdown of how to leverage events for the Calendar widget:**

1. **Define an Event Handler:** In your `ComponentController` file, create a function that will be triggered when the user selects a date on the Calendar widget. For example:

```javascript
// ComponentController.js
function onCalendarDateSelected(event) {
  // The selected date will be in a format like 'YYYY-MM-DD'
  var selectedDate = event.selectedDate;  

  // Process the selected date as needed.
  console.log(""Selected Date: "", selectedDate);

  // You can also update other widgets in your component using 
  // the selected date: 
  this.view.myLabel.text = ""Selected Date: "" + selectedDate;
}
```

2. **Bind the Event:** In your component's `HTML` file or in the Iris Designer, use the `onDateSelected` event attribute to attach the `onCalendarDateSelected` function to your Calendar widget. Ensure you have provided the correct ID for your Calendar widget.

```html
<Calendar id=""myCalendar"" onDateSelected=""onCalendarDateSelected""></Calendar>
```

Now, whenever the user selects a date on the `myCalendar` widget, the `onCalendarDateSelected` function will be triggered within your component controller, allowing you to process the selected date and update other widgets accordingly.

**For more advanced scenarios, consider:**

* **Using Data Binding:** Bind the Calendar widget's selected date directly to a model property. This will keep your data and UI components synchronized automatically.

* **Customizing the Calendar:** Use the `calendarMonthYearSelectionDropdownView` parameter in the `voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors` API to customize the Calendar widget's appearance. 

* **Refer to the Volt MX Iris Documentation:** The Volt MX Iris documentation ([https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Calendar.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Calendar.html)) provides detailed information on the Calendar widget, events, and data binding.

2024-08-09 10:18:08.034423 UTC,how can I store / set the image captured through camera widget in volt mx Iris,"Volt MX Iris doesn't provide a direct way to store an image directly captured through its Camera widget. However, you can use its built-in API to access the Camera widget's captured image and save it to a file in a location where your Volt MX Iris application can access it.

Here's a step-by-step procedure:

1. **Capture the image:** Use the `captureImage` method of the Camera widget to capture an image. This method returns a path to the captured image file.
2. **Retrieve captured image path:** Store the return value of the `captureImage` method in a variable.
3. **Use the `File` object:** Create a `File` object and set its path to the captured image path retrieved in step 2.
4. **Copy the image:**  Use the `copyFile` method to copy the captured image to a specified location where Volt MX Iris can access it.

Here's an example of how you can implement this using JavaScript:

```javascript
// Capture an image using the Camera widget
voltmx.camera.captureImage(function(imagePath) {
    // Retrieve the captured image path
    var capturedImagePath = imagePath;

    // Create a File object with the captured image path
    var capturedImageFile = new File(capturedImagePath);

    // Specify the directory where you want to save the image
    var destinationDirectory = ""your/directory/path""; 
    var destinationPath = destinationDirectory + ""/"" +  ""captured_image.jpg""; 

    // Copy the captured image to the desired directory 
    voltmx.file.copyFile(capturedImageFile, destinationPath, function(success) {
        // Handle success callback
        if (success) {
            // Success message, use the image in Volt MX Iris
            alert(""Image saved successfully!"");
        } else {
            // Handle any errors during file copy
            alert(""Failed to copy image!"");
        }
    });
});

```

**Explanation:**

* The `voltmx.camera.captureImage()` method triggers the camera and returns the path to the captured image file.
* This path is stored in the `capturedImagePath` variable.
* A `File` object (`capturedImageFile`) is created to represent the image.
* The `destinationPath` variable defines the target location for saving the image.
* The `voltmx.file.copyFile()` method copies the image to the `destinationPath`, and the callback function handles the success or failure of the copy operation.

**Important Considerations:**

* Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the camera and storage in your mobile application.
* The target directory defined in `destinationDirectory` should exist within your Volt MX Iris project's file system.
*  `capturedImagePath` returned by `captureImage` represents the temporary path assigned to the image by the camera. You have to copy these images to a permanent location using `copyFile` to ensure they are available to your application.

2024-08-09 10:40:45.373813 UTC,how can I create an animation of widgets in Iris ?,"You can create animations for widgets in Volt MX Iris by leveraging the ""Animations"" capabilities within the Button widget. To do so, you can follow this approach:

1. **Create a Button Widget:** Design and place a Button widget on your form where you want the animation to be triggered.
2. **""On-Click"" Event:**  The Button widget has an ""On Click"" event that enables you to define the actions to perform when the button is clicked.
3. **Choose the Target Widget:** Decide on the widget you want to animate, whether it's for movement, rotation, or scaling. 
4. **Configure the Animation:**  Within the Button's ""On Click"" event, you can set the animation properties directly.  The properties you use will depend on the type of animation.  For example:\
    * **Movement (Translation):** Set the `left`, `top`, `centerX`, or `centerY` properties of the target widget to create movement. The `doLayout` method is also used within the `onClick` event for positioning the target widget. \
    * **Rotation:**  Set the `rotation` property of the target widget to rotate by a specific degree value. You can also use `rotate` property.
    * **Scaling:** Define the `width` and `height` properties (or `scaleX` and `scaleY`) of the target widget to scale it up or down. \
5. **""doLayout"" Method:**  To ensure the animation is properly displayed and updated, use the `doLayout` method within the Button's `onClick` event.
6. **Test and Refine:**  Run your application and test the animation. You might want to adjust the values for the animation properties until you achieve the desired visual effect. 

**Here's a simplified example of animating a container widget using a Button:**

```javascript
// Event handler for the Button ""onClick"" event
function Button_OnClick() {
  // Get the container widget you want to animate
  var container = voltmx.ui.getWidget(""containerID"");

  // Set the desired position for the container (example)
  container.centerX = 100;  
  container.centerY = 150;  
  
  // Update the layout (essential for animation to work correctly)
  container.doLayout();
}
```

**Explanation:**

*  The `Button_OnClick` function is triggered when the Button is clicked.
*  We get a reference to the container widget using its `id` (""containerID"").
*  We set the `centerX` and `centerY` properties to the desired position.
*  The `doLayout` method tells the container to redraw itself with the new positions.
*  You can adjust the values for `centerX`, `centerY`, `rotation`, `width`, or `height`, etc., depending on the specific animation you're aiming for. 

For more advanced animations, you can explore animation frameworks such as **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)**.  To integrate GSAP with Volt MX Iris, follow these steps:

1. **Add GSAP in your application:**  Include GSAP's JavaScript library (or a specific module) in your Volt MX Iris application.
2. **Use GSAP for Animations:**  Write your animation logic using the GSAP API, similar to how you'd use it in any other JavaScript environment.  You can control various animation properties (position, rotation, scale, and more) with GSAP. 

Remember that the best approach for creating animations will depend on the specific needs of your application. The provided example is a starting point; you can explore the Volt MX Iris documentation and additional resources for more elaborate animation techniques. 

**Remember:**  To achieve smoother animations, optimize the code and test on different devices to ensure your animations work as intended.

2024-08-09 10:43:29.841351 UTC,"how can I Change the textShadow property of a label programatically, it doesnt apply run time even when we set","You can change the textShadow property of a label programmatically in Volt MX Iris by using the `voltmx.theme` API. Here's how:

1. **Get the current theme:** Use the `voltmx.theme.getTheme()` method to retrieve the current theme object. This will give you a JSON object containing the theme settings.

2. **Modify the textShadow property:**  Within the theme object, locate the ""Label"" section (if it exists).  If not, create it.  Inside the ""Label"" section, you can update the `textShadow` property with your desired value.  

3. **Set the modified theme:**   Apply the changes to the theme using the `voltmx.theme.setTheme` method. Pass the modified theme JSON object as the `jsonString` parameter.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Get the current theme
var currentTheme = voltmx.theme.getTheme();

// Modify the textShadow property for the Label
currentTheme.Label = {
    textShadow: ""4px 4px 4px #888888"" // Example value, adjust as needed
};

//set the updated theme
voltmx.theme.setTheme(JSON.stringify(currentTheme));
```

**Explanation:**

* `voltmx.theme.getTheme()` retrieves the current theme settings.
* `currentTheme.Label` accesses the ""Label"" section of the theme, where you can modify properties for all labels. 
* We set the `textShadow` property to a specific value (e.g., ""4px 4px 4px #888888""). Adjust these values based on the desired shadow effect (offset, blur, color).
* `voltmx.theme.setTheme()` applies the modified theme object to your application.

**Important Notes:**

* **Theme Updates:** Modifying the theme using the `voltmx.theme.setTheme` method might require a UI refresh (such as refreshing the form or the widget) to reflect the changes immediately. 
* **Default.themes File:** To understand the available properties and values for the ""Label"" section, refer to the `default.themes` file in the **build-> dist -> Project folder-> assets path** of your Volt MX Iris project. 
* **Test Carefully:** Always test your application thoroughly after modifying themes to ensure the visual styling behaves as expected across different devices and platforms.

By using this approach, you can programmatically modify the `textShadow` property for a label in your Volt MX Iris application, achieving greater flexibility in styling your UI elements.

2024-08-09 11:23:14.652065 UTC,can we add flex container inside hbox of Iris ?,"While the provided context focuses on Container Widgets like FlexContainer and FlexScrollContainer, it doesn't directly mention the ability to add a FlexContainer within an HBox. However, based on general web development practices, you typically can't directly nest one layout container (like a FlexContainer) within another layout container (like an HBox) if they are from different layout models in Volt MX Iris.  Each layout container often has its own positioning and styling rules, which may not be compatible with each other.

Here's why this might be challenging:

* **Layout Conflicts:** Using an HBox implies a horizontal layout, while a FlexContainer allows for more flexible positioning and alignment. Trying to combine these layout models within the same container can lead to unexpected behaviors and conflicts.
* **Confusing Layouts:**  Mixing different layout models can result in a complicated and difficult-to-manage layout structure, making your UI design less maintainable.

**Alternative Approaches:**

1. **Use a Single Layout Model:** To manage the layout effectively, consistently use either HBox for a horizontal flow or FlexContainer for a flexible and more customizable layout. 
2. **Group Widgets Together:**  Consider using other methods to group your widgets within the HBox.  You can use a container like a `FlexContainer` to wrap the set of widgets you want to display in a row. You can then position that `FlexContainer` within the `HBox`.
3. **Use a FlexScrollContainer:** If you need both horizontal scrolling and flexible content arrangements similar to a FlexContainer, consider using a `FlexScrollContainer`.  This offers the flexibility of FlexContainers combined with scrolling capabilities.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Assuming you have an HBox with the ID 'hbox1'
var hbox = voltmx.ui.getWidget(""hbox1"");

// Create a FlexContainer
var flexContainer = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({
    id: ""flexContainer1"",
    width: ""100%"",  // Example width for the FlexContainer
    height: ""50dp"", // Example height for the FlexContainer
    layoutType: voltmx.ui.LayoutType.HORIZONTAL 
});

// Add any widgets to the FlexContainer (e.g., Label, Button)
// ...

// Add the FlexContainer to the HBox
hbox.add(flexContainer);

// Update the layout of the HBox
hbox.doLayout();
```

**Remember:**  Always test your application thoroughly after making changes to layouts to ensure the visual rendering behaves as expected across different devices and platforms. 

For further guidance, consult the official Volt MX Iris documentation and look for specific details on how `HBox` and `FlexContainer` widgets interact and interact with other layout containers:  [https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/PopulatingWidgets.html#basic-widgets](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/PopulatingWidgets.html#basic-widgets)

2024-08-09 12:40:43.851309 UTC,how to create mvc app and build for android?,"To create an MVC application and build it for Android using VoltMX Iris, you need to follow a structured approach that combines the UI design, data handling, and application logic.  While VoltMX Iris doesn't directly enforce an MVC architecture, it provides the tools to build an equivalent structure. Here's a general guide to creating a VoltMX Iris application that follows MVC principles:

**1. Define Your Model (Data)**

* **Data Objects:**  Create data objects that represent the data structure of your application. These can be plain JavaScript objects or more complex classes.
* **Data Handling:** Implement methods to interact with data, such as database operations, data retrieval, and data validation. 
    * **Database:** VoltMX Iris supports SQLite databases for local data storage. You can use the `voltmx.data` namespace to interact with the database.
    * **API Calls:** If you need data from a server, you can make API calls using the `voltmx.http` API or integrate with back-end services within a Foundry app. 

**2. Design Your View (UI)**

* **UI Elements:**  Use the VoltMX Iris UI elements to create the visual structure of your app.
* **Data Binding:**  Bind the data (from your model) to the UI elements dynamically. 
   * **Segment Widgets:** For displaying lists of data items.
   * **Form Widgets:** For user input and data validation.
   * **Labels:** For displaying data. 

**3. Create Your Controller (Logic)**

* **Event Handlers:** Implement event handlers for user interactions, such as button clicks or form submissions.
* **Business Logic:** Put your business logic in dedicated JavaScript functions that will be called from event handlers.
* **Data Manipulation:** Use JavaScript to manipulate data from the model in response to user actions.
* **UI Updates:** Update your UI elements based on the changes in your data model. 

**Build for Android:**

1. **Build in Debug Mode:** 
    * From the ""Product"" menu in VoltMX Iris, click ""Build.""
    * In the Build dialog box, select ""Debug"" from the ""Build Mode"" dropdown list.
2. **Build and Publish Native:** 
    * From the ""Build"" menu in VoltMX Iris, click ""Build and Publish Native.""
    * Again, in the Build dialog box, select ""Debug"" from the ""Build Mode"" dropdown list. 
3. **Launch the App:** Launch the application on your connected Android emulator or device (make sure your device is connected using a USB cable).

**Additional Tips:**

* **Modularize Your Code:** Break down your code into separate JavaScript files to achieve better organization and maintainability (consider using modules or namespaces).
* **Use VoltMX APIs:** Take advantage of the rich set of VoltMX Iris APIs to enhance your app's functionality (e.g., camera, geolocation, accelerometer, etc).
* **Test Your App:** Use the Jasmine testing framework within VoltMX Iris to write test cases and verify the correctness of your application's logic. 

**Remember:** VoltMX Iris's ""Data & Services"" panel is a powerful tool that helps with data integration. You can use it to connect to external APIs and databases, further simplifying the process of implementing an MVC-like architecture in your VoltMX application.

2024-08-09 08:50:40.605242 UTC,what are the use cases of offline objects?,"Offline Objects allows your apps to function seamlessly even when internet connectivity is unavailable. This feature enables you to download data from Foundry's Object Services onto a user's device, allowing them to continue using the application and its features offline. The downloaded data can be synced back to the Foundry server once the device regains internet access. This opens up a wide range of use cases, particularly for scenarios where network connectivity is unreliable or non-existent. Here are a few examples:

* **Field service applications:** This is one of the most common use cases for Offline Objects. Field service workers often operate in remote areas with limited or no internet access. Offline Objects allow them to collect data, create records, update information, and perform other tasks even when offline. 
* **Data collection applications:** Offline Objects are ideal for applications that require data collection over extended periods, such as surveys, inspections, or inventory management. Data can be collected offline and then synchronized with the server in bulk when connectivity is available.
* **Mobile banking applications:** Users may need to access their account information or perform transactions while offline. Offline Objects can be used to cache account data and transaction history, enabling seamless functionality even without an active internet connection.
* **Salesforce applications:** Salesforce is a popular cloud-based CRM platform. Offline Objects can be used to enable Salesforce apps to function offline, allowing sales representatives to access customer data and update records without an internet connection.
* **Offline document editing:** Offline Objects can be used to store and synchronize documents for offline editing, allowing users to continue working on documents even when they are not connected to the internet.

These are just a few examples illustrating the versatility of the Offline Objects feature. Its ability to enable applications to function offline expands the possibilities for mobile application development, enabling functionality in environments where internet access is unreliable or unavailable.

2024-08-09 09:11:13.554830 UTC,How can a developer retrieve the data values currently entered or selected by the user within a specific form ?,"To retrieve the data values that a user has entered or selected within a specific form in Volt MX Iris, you can utilize the `getValue` function of the `com.konylabs.vm.ui.KonyWidget` object. This function allows you to access the value held by a specific widget, retrieving information from user inputs.

Here's how to apply this function:

1. **Identify the Form:** Determine the name of the form where the data is entered or selected.  

2. **Access the Widget:** Use the `kony.ui.getFormWidget()` method to access the specific form within your application.  

3. **Locate the Widget:** Determine which widget on the form contains the user-entered data. This could be a text box, dropdown, or any other input widget. 

4. **Retrieve the Value:** Utilize the `getValue` function to retrieve the data from the widget:

   ```javascript
   // Access the form
   var formWidget = kony.ui.getFormWidget(""YourFormName""); // Replace ""YourFormName"" with the actual form name

   // Retrieve the value from a widget 
   var widgetValue = formWidget.widgetId.getValue(); // Replace ""widgetId"" with the actual ID of the widget containing the data
   ```

   For example, if you have a text box with an ID of `txtInput` within the form, you would use: 

   ```javascript
   var widgetValue = formWidget.txtInput.getValue();
   ```

5. **Perform Operations:**  You can use the retrieved value (`widgetValue`) for actions such as: 
    * **Displaying the data:** Use `widgetValue` to show the user's input in another widget.
    * **Storing the data:** Save the value to a variable or database for later use.
    * **Comparing the data:** Check if the entered value fulfills certain criteria.
    * **Validating the input:** Verify that the entered value meets specific conditions.

By following these steps, you can effectively retrieve and utilize the data entered or selected by the user within a specific form in your Volt MX Iris application.

2024-08-09 09:16:40.347582 UTC,can we design a pre-post processor in Foundry for Orchestration service?,"Yes, you can design pre- and post-processors within Foundry for Orchestration services. Foundry allows you to specify multiple preprocessors and postprocessors for both Integration/Orchestration services and Object services.  These preprocessors and postprocessors are implemented using Java classes that implement the ObjectServicePreProcessor and ObjectServicePostProcessor interfaces. 

**Here's how you can design pre- and post-processors in a Foundry Orchestration service:**

1. **Navigate to the Orchestration Service:** Using the Foundry console, access the Orchestration service you want to configure.
2. **Locate the 'Custom Code Invocation' Section:** Within the service configuration, look for the section labeled ""Custom Code Invocation.""
3. **Configure Preprocessors:** In the ""Preprocessor"" section, you can specify either a Java class, custom JavaScript, or rules to execute before the core logic of the Orchestration service. 
    * **Java:**  You can select one or more Java classes that implement the `ObjectServicePreProcessor` interface. The code within these classes will be executed before the Orchestration service's logic.
    * **JavaScript:** If you prefer to use JavaScript, you can specify custom JavaScript code within a dedicated text box. 
    * **Rules:** You can also apply rules to control the preprocessor execution. 
4. **Configure Postprocessors:** Repeat the process from step 3 for the ""Postprocessor"" section, but now configure the code to execute after the core logic of the Orchestration service. 
5. **Order of Execution:** Importantly, you can change the order in which the preprocessors and postprocessors are executed. This allows you to tailor the execution flow and ensure the correct sequence of custom logic application.

**Important Considerations:**
* **JAR File Requirement:** To invoke preprocessors and postprocessors, you *must* import a valid JAR file when creating or modifying the Orchestration service.  This JAR file should contain the Java classes used as preprocessors and postprocessors.
* **Uploading JAR Files:** Upload the JAR files to the Volt MX Foundry console under the ""Advanced"" tab in the Orchestration service definition. 


The preprocessor and postprocessor classes in Foundry give you a lot of control over how your Orchestration services functions. They can be used to: 

* **Validate incoming data:** Ensure that the data received by the Orchestration service meets your requirements before it's processed. 
* **Transform data:** Modify or reformat data before it's sent to the backend service.
* **Add additional functionality:** Perform actions like logging or auditing before or after the service executes. 

For additional guidance, consult the ""Integration Services"" section of the Foundry documentation, which explains pre- and post-processor functionalities in detail.

2024-08-09 09:19:15.937679 UTC,share an example of a pre-post processor implementation in orchestration services?,"You're asking for an example of a pre-post processor implementation in Orchestration services.  I can help you with that.  Here's an example of a Java pre-processor class that validates incoming data and a post-processor class that logs the successful execution of an Orchestration service:

**Preprocessor Class:**

```java
import com.hcl.domino.integration.service.OrchestrationPreProcessor;
import com.hcl.domino.integration.service.OrchestrationPreProcessorContext;
import com.hcl.domino.integration.service.exception.SkipOrchestrationServiceInvocationException;

public class DataValidationPreProcessor implements OrchestrationPreProcessor {

    @Override
    public void process(OrchestrationPreProcessorContext context) throws SkipOrchestrationServiceInvocationException {
        // Get the input data from the context
        String inputData = (String) context.getPayload().get(Constants.DATA_FIELD);

        // Validate the data
        if (inputData == null || inputData.isEmpty()) {
            throw new SkipOrchestrationServiceInvocationException(""Invalid input data"");
        }

        // Modify the input data if necessary (e.g., trim spaces)
        inputData = inputData.trim();

        // Update the context with the validated data
        context.getPayload().put(Constants.DATA_FIELD, inputData);
    }
}
```

In this pre-processor, the `process` method receives the input data using `context.getPayload().get(Constants.DATA_FIELD)`.  The code then checks if the data is empty or null. If the code detects an issue, it throws a `SkipOrchestrationServiceInvocationException`,  preventing the orchestration service from executing. If validation is successful, the data is then updated in the context to be used by the next stage of the orchestration service.

**Postprocessor Class:**

```java
import com.hcl.domino.integration.service.OrchestrationPostProcessor;
import com.hcl.domino.integration.service.OrchestrationPostProcessorContext;
import com.hcl.domino.integration.service.exception.SkipOrchestrationServicePostProcessingException;

public class LoggingPostProcessor implements OrchestrationPostProcessor {

    @Override
    public void process(OrchestrationPostProcessorContext context) throws SkipOrchestrationServicePostProcessingException {
        // Check if the service executed successfully
        if (context.isExecutionSuccessful()) {
            // Get the output data from the context
            String outputData = (String) context.getPayload().get(Constants.OUTPUT_FIELD);

            // Log the successful execution and output data
            System.out.println(""Orchestration service executed successfully. Output data: "" + outputData);
        } else {
            // Log the error that occurred
            System.err.println(""Orchestration service execution failed. Error: "" + context.getException().getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

This post-processor checks if the orchestration service executed successfully.  If successful, the post-processor logs a message indicating success and the output data.  If the service fails, it logs an error message to indicate the failure.   

**Note:**

* This example uses a simple validation check and logging. You can alter these checks and logging to fit your specific needs.
* The code assumes `Constants.DATA_FIELD` and `Constants.OUTPUT_FIELD` are constants that refer to the keys used for accessing data within the context.  
* In Foundry, you would need to compile these classes together into a JAR file.  
* Next, import the JAR file when creating your Orchestration service, and specify the pre-processor and post-processor classes, which will be executed when the orchestration service is called.

2024-08-09 12:34:23.098689 UTC,how to implement copyBundledRawFileTo API functionality in the Native Desktop channel? why do we need this?,"The `copyBundledRawFileTo` API, found within the `voltmx.io.FileSystem` namespace, is designed for copying a file from your application's binary to a specific destination path on the device.  You can use it to manage files that are part of your application's package. This API enables scenarios like:

* **Resource Handling:**  To access files included in your app's build, `copyBundledRawFileTo` lets you retrieve these files from the bundle and use them.
* **Data Access:**  When your application requires pre-bundled data files (like configuration files or data sets), this API can copy these files to a location for easy access.
* **Offline Functionality:**  To make your application work even without an  internet connection, you can use `copyBundledRawFileTo` to copy relevant files (images, audio, or data) from the bundle. 
* **Specific File Needs:**  If you must provide a specific file to your application during development or execution, `copyBundledRawFileTo` can move the file from the bundled resources into the device's file system.  

The documentation explicitly mentions that the `copyBundledRawFileTo` API is available for the ""Desktop Web"" channel. However, it is not directly supported in the ""Native Desktop"" channel.  If you require this functionality, you can explore these approaches:

*   **Use Third-Party Libraries:**  Research and utilize compatible third-party libraries that provide file system functionality within the Electron environment to replicate the behavior of `copyBundledRawFileTo`.  
*   **Write Custom Code:**  Manually write code that interacts with Electron's APIs to access your application's bundled files and copy them to the desired destination within the desktop environment.   
*   **Change Bundling Strategies:**  For Native Desktop apps, you could consider bundling files with the application and accessing them directly from the package, rather than copying them to another location on the desktop.

2024-08-09 10:59:03.999464 UTC,How to implement app login which use google service provider?,"You can implement an app login using Google as the service provider through the OAuth 2.0 setup in Volt MX Foundry. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

**1. Configure Google OAuth 2.0 Settings:**

* **Create a Google Cloud Project:**  Go to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project. This project will house your Google OAuth 2.0 configuration.
* **Enable the Google+ API:**  Within your project, enable the Google+ API, as it's essential for OAuth 2.0 authentication.
* **Set Up OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**  Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials** in your Google Cloud project. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials by choosing ""OAuth client ID.""  You'll select the application type (web application in this case) and provide the necessary details, including the **Authorized redirect URIs** and **App Domain**.
* **Register Callback URL:**  In the **Authorized redirect URIs** field, you need to register the callback URL provided by Volt MX Foundry. You'll need to replace `<accountID>` with your actual account ID. This URL allows Google to redirect the user back to your app after authenticating.
* **Set App Domain:** As a best practice, in the **App Domain** field, specify the domain provided by Volt MX Foundry (`auth.voltmxcloud.com`). This ensures that Google properly identifies the origin of the requests coming from your application.

**2. Configure Volt MX Foundry OAuth 2.0 Identity Service:**

* **Create a New Identity Service:**  Navigate to the Identity Services section in Volt MX Foundry. Create a new identity service, specifying the settings related to Google OAuth 2.0:
    * **OAuth 2.0 Service Provider:** Select Google as the service provider.
    * **Authorize Endpoint:** Enter the `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth` endpoint (provided in the context). 
    * **Token Endpoint:** Enter the `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token` endpoint (provided in the context).
    * **Scope:** Define the permissions you need from the user.  For example, if you only need the user's name and email, specify `profile` and `email` as scopes in the text box, separated by spaces.
* **Register Client Credentials:**  Fill in the client ID and client secret obtained from your Google Cloud project credentials.  
* **Configure Identity Service:**  Your Identity Service will now use these settings to manage the authentication process with Google. 

**3. Implement Google Login in Volt MX Iris Application:**

* **Incorporate OAuth 2.0 Widget:**  In your Volt MX Iris application, add the **OAuth 2.0 Widget**. This enables you to initiate the authentication process.
* **Configure Widget:**  Configure the OAuth 2.0 widget to use the Identity Service you created in Foundry.
* **Handle Callback:**  When the user successfully authenticates with Google, the OAuth 2.0 Widget will receive a callback. This callback contains the access token and other information.  You can capture this data and use it to perform actions such as:
    *   **Storing User Information:**  Persist the user's data from the Google response (e.g., name, email) in your application for future use.
    *   **API Requests:**  Use the access token for making protected API calls to Google services on behalf of the user. 
    *   **Authenticating User:**  Consider setting a session variable to indicate that the user is successfully logged in.
* **Manage User Session:**  Once the user is successfully authenticated, you need to manage their session within your application. Consider using session variables or other mechanisms to ensure that users can access protected resources after successfully logging in. 

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:**  Always handle the access token securely.  Do not store it directly in the client-side application. Use a secure storage mechanism like local storage on the device (for mobile) or server-side sessions (for web).
*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling for scenarios where authentication fails or issues arise during the process. Provide users with informative messages guiding them through the steps. 
*   **Refresh Tokens:**  You can optionally use Google refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens when the existing access token expires. This can help keep users logged in without requiring them to re-authenticate constantly.

**Additional Resources:**

*   **Volt MX Documentation:**  Refer to the Volt MX documentation for detailed information about implementing the OAuth 2.0 widget in Iris.
*   **Google OAuth 2.0 Documentation:**  Consult Google's OAuth 2.0 documentation for thorough understanding of using Google as an identity provider. 
*   **HCL Support:**  If you encounter any difficulties, utilize the HCL Volt MX support resources for assistance.

By following these steps and referencing the resources provided, you can successfully implement Google login within your Volt MX Iris applications. This allows users to authenticate securely using their existing Google accounts, streamlining the login process and enhancing the user experience.

2024-08-09 11:24:13.189473 UTC,How is XCFrameworks used in Volt Iris?,"The provided documentation doesn't specify any direct usage of XCFrameworks in Volt MX Iris, nor does it mention anything about frameworks related to iOS development within the context of Volt MX Iris.  

However, if you're referring to creating custom widgets for iOS,  you can utilize XCFrameworks as part of the development process.  Here's a breakdown of how XCFrameworks can be incorporated:

1. **Creating a Custom Widget Class Implementation:**  You start by implementing your custom widget class, which would ideally reside within an XCFramework project.  Remember that this custom widget implementation needs to adhere to the Volt MX Iris Custom Widget protocol (CWIWidget).  Implement the mandatory methods within this protocol to handle initialization, rendering, and property management.
2. **Building the XCFramework:** Once you've implemented your custom widget code, you would build the XCFramework using Xcode. 
3. **Integrating the XCFramework in Iris:** After you create the XCFramework, you would import it into your Volt MX Iris project.  This would enable Iris to access the custom widget defined within the XCFramework. 

While the documentation doesn't explicitly guide you through this process, consider these points:

* **Integrating XCFrameworks with Iris:**  It may require some additional configuration or bridge code to properly connect the XCFramework to the Volt MX Iris environment. You may need to utilize appropriate JavaScript bridge code within your Iris application to communicate with the custom widget defined in the XCFramework.
* **Testing:** After integration, thorough testing is essential to ensure the custom widget behaves correctly within your Iris application and integrates seamlessly with the platform. 

Remember that this approach might require specific knowledge of both XCFrameworks development and Volt MX Iris's custom widget protocol.  You can find more detailed information on building custom widgets for iOS in the ""iOS Custom Widget"" section of the Volt MX Iris documentation.  If you encounter any issues or require extra guidance, consider consulting additional resources and communities for support.

2024-08-09 11:31:16.184995 UTC,"what API in Volt Iris can be used to detect device movement and orientation, so as to create engaging animations?","The Volt MX Iris documentation you've provided covers device movement and orientation detection under the **Accelerometer API**.  Here's how you can use it to create engaging animations:

1.  **Include the Accelerometer API:**  You'll need to include the Accelerometer API in your Iris application. This allows you to access the device's movement and orientation data. This involves referencing the `voltmx.accelerometer` namespace in your JavaScript code. 

2.  **Capture Movement Data:** Utilize the `voltmx.accelerometer.getCurrentAcceleration` function to capture the device's current acceleration along the X, Y, and Z axes.  This gives you the raw data about the device's movement. 

3.  **Register Shake Gestures:** You can use the `voltmx.accelerometer.registerForShakeGesture` function to make your app respond to the shake gesture.  This allows you to trigger animations or other actions based on the user shaking their device. 

4.  **Implement Animations:** Use the data collected from the accelerometer to drive the animations. You can leverage the **Animation API** (`voltmx.animation`) to change the position, rotation, scale, or other properties of UI elements in response to the device's movement. You'll need to adjust the animation properties (like duration, timing, and easing) to match the desired visual effect and smoothness.

**Example:**

```javascript
// Register for shake gesture
voltmx.accelerometer.registerForShakeGesture(function() {
  // Implement animation when shake gesture is detected
  // Example: Spin an image 360 degrees
  var animationObj = new voltmx.animation.Animation(
    {
      0: {
        // Initial properties
        ""left"": ""0dp"",
        ""top"": ""0dp""
      },
      100: {
        // Properties after 100% duration
        ""left"": ""200dp"",
        ""top"": ""200dp""
      }
    },
    {
      duration: 2000, // Animation duration
      fillMode: voltmx.animation.Animation.FILL_MODE_FORWARDS,
      iterationCount: 1 // Run animation once
    }
  );

  // Apply the animation to the image widget
  animationObj.animate(kony.ui.getWidget(""imageWidget""));

}, this);
```

**Important Notes:**

*   **Device Orientation:**  For detecting device orientation specifically, you can utilize other APIs like the **Orientation API** if needed. 
*   **Smoothness and Responsiveness:**  For creating seamless animations, optimize your code to handle the incoming accelerometer data efficiently.  This can involve using requestAnimationFrame or other techniques for smooth animation updates.
*   **Battery Considerations:** Be mindful of battery consumption when using the accelerometer continuously.  Consider implementing a mechanism to disable it when not in use to conserve battery life.

This approach enables you to create dynamic, engaging animations based on user interactions and the device's physical movement. Use the documentation for the Accelerometer API and Animation API, experimentation, and design principles to create compelling animation effects in your Volt MX Iris application!

2024-08-09 13:02:43.229525 UTC,I would like to understand the approach to fetch the data from a rest service and process it locally in foundry then pass on the same to Iris application to show in segment,"To achieve this, you can utilize the powerful combination of Volt MX Foundry's server-side capabilities and the Iris client-side integration. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Define Your REST Service in Foundry:** \n    *   Create a new REST service in Volt MX Foundry.  This service will be responsible for fetching data from your external REST API.\n    *   Configure the service with the appropriate URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and any required headers or parameters. \n    *   Write logic to handle the response from the external REST API and process the data as needed. You might need to filter, transform, or manipulate the data to match the format expected by Iris.\n\n2. **Expose the Service in Foundry:**\n    *   Make sure your Foundry REST service is properly exposed and accessible to your Iris application. You might need to use Foundry's built-in mechanisms for service discovery or authentication.\n\n3. **Create a Project Service in Iris:**\n    *   Open your Iris application in Volt MX Iris.\n    *   Navigate to the **Data & Services panel** and select **Integration Services**.\n    *   Go to **Create New Service** and choose **Invoke REST Service**.\n    *   Fill in the details for the service, such as name, description, and the URL pointing to your Foundry REST service.\n    *   Configure the service parameters and set the expected response structure (e.g., JSON format).\n    *   Save the service operation.\n\n4. **Fetch Data in Iris:**\n    *   In your Iris form or module, use the `invokeService` method to call the project service you just created.  This will trigger a call to your Foundry service, which will then fetch data from the external REST API.\n    *   Handle the response from your project service. The response will likely be in JSON format; use the `JSON.parse()` method to convert the response string into a JavaScript object.\n\n5. **Process Data in Iris:**\n    *   You can process the data fetched from your Foundry REST service within your Iris application. For example, you might need to perform additional data transformations, filter data, or sort data before displaying it in the Segment.\n\n6. **Display Data in Segment:**\n    *   Use the `setData` method of the Segment widget to populate it with the processed data from your Foundry service.  Make sure your data is structured in a way that matches the design of the Segment rows (labels, values, and any other relevant content). \n\n**Example (`frmMain.js` on Iris):**\n\n```javascript  // Assuming your project service is named ""GetExternalData""  
function btnFetchData_onClick() {  
	var segData = []; 
	voltmx.services.invokeService(""GetExternalData"", {}, function(success) {  
		var dataObj = JSON.parse(success.response); // Parse JSON response 
		// Transform the data based on your needs 
		dataObj.forEach(function(item) {  
			segData.push({ label: item.name, value: item.id }); // Assuming your data has ""name"" and ""id"" properties 
		});
		var seg = voltmx.ui.getWidget(""segment1""); // Replace ""segment1"" with your segment widget ID 
		seg.setData(segData);  
	}, function(error) {  
		alert(error.errorMessage); 
	});

```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `voltmx.services.invokeService()` calls the `GetExternalData` project service. \n*   `JSON.parse(success.response)` converts the JSON response from the Foundry service into a JavaScript object. \n*   The code processes the data using a `forEach` loop to create a new array (`segData`) suitable for the Segment widget. \n*   `seg.setData(segData)` fills the Segment widget with the updated data.

**Additional Tips:**\n\n*   **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling mechanisms in all steps (Foundry service, Iris project service, and within your Iris code). This includes catching exceptions, providing useful error messages, and potentially attempting retries.\n*   **Data Structure:** Ensure that the data structure coming from the external REST API, the Foundry service, and the Iris application aligns seamlessly. \n*   **Load Indicators:** Consider adding load indicators or progress bars to provide feedback to the user while the data is being fetched and processed.\n\nRemember that this approach is a general pattern. You might need to make adjustments and adapt the code based on your specific requirements. Utilize the official Volt MX Iris and Foundry documentation for detailed examples and best practices.\n\n",Info is helpful but the content (as response) is shown not properly aligned.,TRUE,bmFyZW5fdm9sdG14X2JlZ2lubmVy,7ff54dc2-29ee-4cbd-929e-cfad4a732db3,2024-08-09T05:21:41.947206,naren,voltmx,Beginner,,
2024-08-09 13:08:31.912911 UTC,is there any other approach that you can suggest,"You are asking for alternative approaches to fetching data from a REST service and processing it locally in Foundry, then passing it to an Iris application for display in a Segment widget.  While the method I previously outlined (using a REST service in Foundry, exposing it, creating a project service in Iris, fetching data, processing, and displaying) is a common and efficient approach, there are alternative methods you can consider.  Here are some approaches you might find helpful:

* **Utilize Foundry's Offline Object Model:** This approach is particularly useful if your data needs to be available offline in your Iris app. 
    * **Configure Offline Enabled Object Service:** In Volt MX Foundry, configure your object service to be ""Offline Enabled"". This allows Foundry to create a local cache of the data for offline access.
    * **Generate Object Model:** Link your Foundry app to your Iris app, and then generate the object model from the Foundry service. This will create a data model in Iris that maps to the Foundry object service.
    * **Access Offline Data:** You can then access this data directly from Iris using the `voltmx.offline` API. For example, you can use the `voltmx.offline.getObjects` method to fetch the data and update your segment in Iris.

   **Advantages:**
    * **Offline Access:**  Ensures data availability even when your app is not connected to the network.
    * **Data Synchronization:**  Provides a simplified approach to synchronize data between Foundry and Iris.

**Direct Integration with REST Service in Iris:**

* **Use Iris Service API** (Refer to Volt MX Iris API docs for the `invokeService` method):  You can invoke the external REST service directly from Iris using the Volt MX Iris `invokeService` method.  
    * **Configure Iris Service:** Create a new service in Iris and configure it to call the desired external REST service. Be mindful of CORS and security considerations when invoking external APIs directly from Iris.
    * **Fetch and Process:** Call the Iris service to fetch the REST data, and process and display it in the Segment widget as needed.

**Advantages:**
* **Direct Control:**  Gives you more direct control over the data fetching and processing in your Iris application.
* **SIMPLER** approach if you don't require the functionality of offline object model provided by Foundry.

**Considerations:**

* **Security and Security Risks:** Accessing external REST APIs directly from Iris might involve security considerations.  Ensure adequate authentication, authorization, and data security practices.
* **Data Transformations:** Make sure you handle any necessary data transformations and formatting to ensure the data is displayed correctly in your Segment widget.
* **Data Synchronisation:** If you need data to be synchronized with a local database, you'll need to implement the synchronization logic within your Iris application or utilize the ""Offline Objects"" feature as mentioned earlier.

Remember, choose the approach that best suits your application's specific requirements.  Consult the Volt MX Iris and Foundry documentation for further details and examples.

2024-08-09 17:45:21.574434 UTC,does voltmx support right to left? Give me some examples,"Yes, VoltMX Iris supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages. This means you can design applications that display text and layout elements in a direction appropriate for RTL languages like Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian.

Here's a breakdown of key considerations and steps for supporting RTL in your VoltMX applications:

**Important Considerations:**

* **Language Selection:**  Ensure you've set up the appropriate language settings for your application in VoltMX Studio.  Consider using the VoltMX Internationalization features to provide language support for different regions.
* **Widget Direction:**  The direction of widgets like Labels, TextAreas, and Buttons should align with the RTL language.

**Supported Widgets:**

Most VoltMX Iris widgets are RTL-aware and will automatically display content correctly when the language of your application is set to an RTL language.

**Configure RTL Layout:**

1. **Properties Pane:**  You can modify some widget properties directly in the VoltMX Studio Properties Pane to help handle RTL layout, though there are some exceptions:
    * **`textAlign`:**  This property can be set to values like `right` or `justify` to control the alignment of text within specific widgets.
2. **Language Setting:**  Make sure your application's language setting is set to an RTL language. This will automatically trigger RTL behavior for many widgets.

**Exceptions for Right-to-Left Layout from Properties Pane:**

Some layout-related properties might not be directly controllable through the Properties Pane for RTL languages.  You'll likely need to make adjustments within your application's JavaScript code.

**Known Limitations:**

* **Third-Party Libraries:**  Be cautious about third-party libraries and components  – you might need to adjust them manually for RTL compatibility.
* **Complex Layouts:**  For very intricate layouts, you may need to manually adjust positioning and sizing based on the language direction.

**Example:**

Think of a form with input fields. In a typical LTR (Left-to-Right) language, the labels are on the left and the input fields are on the right. For an RTL language, the labels are positioned on the right, and the input fields are on the left, ensuring readability for users accustomed to reading from right to left.

**For more information about RTL support in VoltMX Iris, you can consult the official VoltMX documentation. You can also find examples and best practices for creating RTL-friendly applications in the community forums.&#x20;**

2024-08-09 13:49:58.864228 UTC,How to write the platform specific code in javascript file?,"To write platform-specific code in a JavaScript file in Iris, you'll need to utilize the `kony.os.deviceInfo` object. This object provides access to various device information, allowing you to differentiate code execution based on the platform.

Here's how you can write platform-specific code in your Iris application:

1. **Include the `kony.os.deviceInfo` Object:** In your JavaScript file, ensure you have included the `kony.os.deviceInfo` object. This object offers several properties to identify the platform (Android, iOS, or Mobile Web).

2. **Check the Platform:** Use the `kony.os.deviceInfo.name` property to determine the current platform. You can then use an `if` or `switch` statement to execute code specific to each platform.

   ```javascript
   function platformSpecificCode() {
       if (kony.os.deviceInfo.name === 'Android') {
           // Execute code specific to Android
           console.log('This is running on Android!');
       } else if (kony.os.deviceInfo.name === 'iOS') {
           // Execute code specific to iOS
           console.log('This is running on iOS!');
       } else if (kony.os.deviceInfo.name === 'Mobile Web') {
           // Execute code specific to Mobile Web
           console.log('This is running on Mobile Web!');
       }
   }
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use a `switch` statement for a more concise structure:

   ```javascript
   function platformSpecificCode() {
       switch (kony.os.deviceInfo.name) {
           case 'Android':
               // Execute code specific to Android
               console.log('This is running on Android!');
               break;
           case 'iOS':
               // Execute code specific to iOS
               console.log('This is running on iOS!');
               break;
           case 'Mobile Web':
               // Execute code specific to Mobile Web
               console.log('This is running on Mobile Web!');
               break;
           default:
               // Handle any other unexpected platform
               console.log('Unknown platform detected!');
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Execute Platform-Specific Logic:** Inside each conditional block, write the JavaScript code that should be executed only on that particular platform. For instance, you could make API calls, manipulate UI elements, or perform any other task that requires platform-specific behavior.

Remember that `kony.os.deviceInfo` gives you a comprehensive insight into the device's configuration. You can use other properties like `deviceInfo.version`, `deviceInfo.manufacturer`, or `deviceInfo.platform` to tailor your code further based on specific device characteristics.

The documentation provided by HCL Technologies contains detailed information about the `kony.os.deviceInfo` object and its capabilities. For more comprehensive guidance and examples of platform-specific code usage in Iris applications, refer to the Volt MX Foundry documentation.

Please be very articulate and give me the full code to make this work.","Let's create a calculator app in VoltMX that works on both iOS and Android platforms.  Here's a step-by-step breakdown with code examples:

**1.  Set Up Your VoltMX Project:**

    *   Open VoltMX Studio and create a new project. 
    *   Name the project something descriptive like ""VoltMXCalculator.""

**2.  Design Your Calculator Form:**

    *   **Create a New Form:**  Add a new form to your project. Let's call it ""frmCalculator.""
    *   **Add Widgets:** Include the following widgets in the form for a basic calculator:
        *   **Text Input (txtDisplay):**  A text input widget to display the numbers and results.  
        *   **Button Widgets (for each operation):**  You'll need buttons for:
            *   ""7"", ""8"", ""9"", ""C"" (Clear) 
            *   ""4"", ""5"", ""6"", ""*"" (Multiply)
            *   ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""-"" (Subtract)
            *   ""0"", ""."", ""+"", ""/"" (Divide)
            *   ""="" (Equals) 
    *   **Layout:** Arrange your widgets to resemble a calculator layout (either horizontally or vertically).

**3.  Implement the JavaScript Logic (`frmCalculator.js`):**

    ```javascript
    var displayValue = """"; // To store the text displayed
    function txtDisplay_onTextChange(text) {
      displayValue = text;
    }
    
    // Function to handle button clicks
    function btnClick(button) {
      var value = button.text; // Get the text from the button
    
      if (value === ""C"") {
        // Clear the display
        this.view.txtDisplay.text = """";
        displayValue = """";
      } else if (value === ""="") {
        // Evaluate the expression and display the result
        try {
          var result = eval(displayValue);
          this.view.txtDisplay.text = result;
          displayValue = result.toString(); 
        } catch (error) {
          // Handle potential errors during evaluation
          this.view.txtDisplay.text = ""Error"";
        }
      } else {
        // Add the button's value to the display
        this.view.txtDisplay.text += value;
        displayValue += value; 
      }
    }
    
    // Attach click events for all buttons
    this.view.btn7.onClick = function() { /* ... btnClick(""7"") ... */ }; 
    this.view.btn8.onClick = function() { /* ... btnClick(""8"") ... */ };
    // ... (Repeat for all other buttons)
    
    this.view.btnEquals.onClick = function() { /* ... btnClick(""="") ... */ };
    ```

**4.  Explanation of the Code:** 

    *   **`txtDisplay_onTextChange`:**  This function is called whenever the text inside the `txtDisplay` widget changes.  It updates the `displayValue` variable.
    *   **`btnClick`:**  This function is called when any button is clicked. 
        *   **""C"" (Clear):**  Clears the display and resets the `displayValue`.
        *   **""=""  (Equals):**  Uses the `eval()` function to evaluate the mathematical expression in `displayValue`. 
            *   The `try...catch` block handles errors if the expression is invalid.  
        *   **Other Buttons:** Appends the button's text to the display and updates the `displayValue`.

 **5.  Make It Work On Both Platforms:**

    *   VoltMX generally handles platform compatibility for most widgets.  Ensure your app's layout works well on both iOS and Android devices. You can use different form layouts (e.g., one layout in Portrait and another one in Landscape) in the VoltMX Studio to ensure a good user experience on both platforms. 

**6.  Test and Deploy:**

    *   **Test thoroughly:**  Use the VoltMX Simulator or build the app on actual devices to test your calculator app. 
    *   **Deploy:** Once you're happy with the functionality, deploy the app to your chosen app stores (App Store for iOS, Google Play Store for Android).

**Important Tips:**

*   **Error Handling:**  Add more robust error handling in your code (especially in the `eval()` function) to catch invalid expressions.  
*   **Advanced Features:** For a more advanced calculator, you could add features like scientific functions, memory, or history.
*   **User Experience:** Keep in mind user interface best practices for clarity and ease of use.

**Remember:**  You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific calculator design and functionality.

      displayValue = savedCalculation;
    }
  }
}
```

**4.  VoltMX Foundry Setup:**

*   **Create a User Store:** In your VoltMX Foundry account, create a new User Store (User Repository) to manage users and authentication.
*   **Add Users:**  Add new users to your User Store.
*   **Add Groups (Optional):**  You can add groups if you need to manage roles and permissions.
*   **Publish the User Store:** Ensure that you publish the User Store to your VoltMX App Services environment.

**5.  Set up Authentication for Your App:**

*   **Open the VoltMX Studio Project:** Open your ""VoltMXCalculator"" project in VoltMX Studio.
*   **Client App Properties:** In VoltMX Studio, navigate to ""Settings"" > ""Deployment Settings"" > ""Native"" > ""Android"" (or ""iOS"") > ""Client App Properties.""
*   **VOLTMX_APPSTORE_LOGIN:**  Add a field:
    *   **Field Name:**  VOLTMX_APPSTORE_LOGIN
    *   **Field Value:** true
* **Save:** Click ""Save"" to apply the changes.

**6.  Connect Your App to VoltMX Foundry:**

*   **Open Your Project:**  Open your VoltMX project in VoltMX Studio.
*   **Connect to Foundry:** 
    *   Navigate to the ""VoltMX Foundry"" tab in your project's settings.
    *   Enter the necessary credentials to connect your app to the Foundry instance where your User Store is published.

**7.  Add Logic to Save Data to Foundry:**

*   **Modify the `btnClick()` function:**
    *   Inside the `if (value === ""="")` block, add the following to save the calculation:
        ```javascript
        var currentCalculation = displayValue; 
        voltmx.store.setItem(""lastCalculation"", currentCalculation);
        // Call a Foundry API/function to store the calculation on the server
        ```
*   **Create an API Endpoint (Optionally):** You can create an API endpoint in your VoltMX Foundry backend (e.g., using a Node.js app or similar) to receive and store the calculation data.

**8.  Test and Deploy:**

*   **Test Thoroughly:** Use the VoltMX Simulator or build the app on actual devices to rigorously test.
*   **Deploy:**  Deploy your calculator app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

**Explaining the Steps:**

1.  **Setting Up the Form and JS:**  We've constructed a basic calculator form and implemented the core functionality for input, calculation, and clearing.  The `eval()` function handles the calculation, and we added a login button.
2.  **VoltMX Foundry Setup:**  We've created a User Repository (User Store) in VoltMX Foundry. This allows your app to manage users, roles, and authentication.
3.  **Enabling Authentication:**  We enabled authentication for your app using the ""VOLTMX_APPSTORE_LOGIN"" property, so users must log in when launching the application.
4.  **Connecting to Foundry:**  We've linked your VoltMX Studio project to the Foundry instance that hosts your User Store. This enables communication and data storage.
5.  **Saving Calculation Data:**  We've added code to save the last calculation to the device's local storage using `voltmx.store.setItem()`.  This ensures it's available when the app relaunches, and for a more robust solution, you could integrate with a Foundry API endpoint to save this data to your Foundry backend.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Authentication Implementation:** You'll need to fill in the actual login logic (using the `voltmx.user.UserStore` object) based on your Foundry setup and user authentication flow.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to manage invalid inputs, calculations, and other possible issues.
*   **Device Storage:** While `voltmx.store.setItem()` saves data locally, using a Foundry API endpoint is a better practice for persistent storage across installs and re-installs.
*   **Advanced Features:**  To really amplify your app, consider adding things like more complex calculations, memory, history, or user profiles.

Remember to test your calculator app thoroughly and adjust the code to fit your design and desired features. You might need to explore additional VoltMX APIs or Foundry integration techniques based on your specific requirements.

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Creating the Form:** We create a new form using `voltmx.ui.Form2` constructor, giving it an ID, title, layout type, and enabling scrolling.
2. **Creating Buttons:** We create two button instances using `voltmx.ui.Button` constructor, each with unique IDs, text, and default width and height. We set the `left`, `top`, `centerX`, and `centerY` properties to center them on the form.
3. **Adding Buttons to the Form:** We use `frm.add(btn1)` and `frm.add(btn2)` to add the buttons to the form.
4. **Showing the Form:** Finally, we call `frm.show()` to display the form and its buttons on the screen.

**Note:** You might need to modify the positions of the buttons depending on your specific layout and form size.  For more detailed information on creating and using forms and buttons in VoltMX, consider looking at the VoltMX official documentation and examples.

2024-08-09 05:41:57.094796 UTC,How customer data is being secured ?,"VoltMX offers several measures to secure customer data, prioritizing data encryption, secure code practices, and robust client-side protection. 

**Encryption:**

* **Cryptographic APIs:** VoltMX provides built-in cryptographic APIs that developers can leverage to encrypt sensitive data stored locally within the application. This ensures that even if the device is compromised, the data remains protected.  

**Secure Code Practices:**

* **Protected Mode:** VoltMX Iris recommends building applications in ""Protected Mode"" for added protection of the application's binary code. This makes it more challenging for attackers to reverse engineer or modify the app's code. 
* **Avoid Clear Text Storage:**  Sensitive information like passwords, connection strings, or other confidential details should NEVER be stored in plain text on the client side. Avoid embedding such information in insecure formats like Microsoft Viewstate, Adobe Flash, or compiled code.
* **Code Obfuscation:** The document recommends removing comments from user-accessible production code that might reveal back-end systems or sensitive information. This practice makes the code more difficult for unauthorized users to understand and exploit.
* **Remove Debug Code:**  Debug code and functionalities should be removed from production code to prevent potential vulnerabilities and unnecessary exposure of sensitive information.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* **Server-Side Code Protection:**  Protect server-side source code from unauthorized downloads. 
* **Secure Backend Integration:** When connecting applications to backend services, ensure that communication channels are secure using encryption and authentication protocols.

VoltMX offers these robust measures to protect customer data effectively. However, always remember that security is an ongoing process. Developers should adopt best practices and secure design principles in conjunction with VoltMX's built-in features to maximize data security and minimize risks.  It's essential to stay updated on the latest security best practices and regularly review and enhance your security measures.

2024-08-09 07:17:28.454940 UTC,how to use checkboxgroup on selection,"To use a CheckBoxGroup widget on selection, you will need to utilize the *onSelection* event. This event is triggered whenever a checkbox within the CheckBoxGroup widget is selected or deselected. You can use it to execute specific actions, such as updating the UI, making API calls, or performing other logic depending on which checkbox was selected.

**Example:** 

```javascript

// Get a reference to the CheckBoxGroup widget
var checkBoxGroup = $$.widgets.getWidgetInstance(""checkboxGroupWidgetID"");

// Add an event listener for the 'onSelection' event
checkBoxGroup.onSelection = function(eventobject, selectedItems, deselectedItems, selectedIds, deselectedIds) {
  console.log(""Selected items: "" +  selectedItems);  // This will show the selected checkboxes values
  console.log(""Deselected items: "" + deselectedItems); // This will show the deselected checkboxes values
  //  add your logic here based on your requirements  
};

```

**Explanation:**

1.  **Get the Widget Instance:** You first need to get a reference to the CheckBoxGroup widget using its ID (e.g., `'checkboxGroupWidgetID'`).
2.  **onSelection Event Listener:** The `onSelection` event is an important part of handling CheckBoxGroup actions. Attach an event listener to it. You can now access and use the selected items.
3.  **Get Selected/Deselected Items:**  The event listener provides event arguments that include details about the selected checkboxes, including their values, IDs, and the items that were deselected.
4.  **Add Custom Logic:** Inside the `onSelection` event handler, you can add your desired logic based on the selected checkboxes. You can perform actions based on the values selected by the User.

**Important Notes:** 

* **Replace Placeholders:** Replace `'checkboxGroupWidgetID'` with the actual ID of your CheckBoxGroup widget in your application.
* **Event Arguments:** The `selectedItems`, `deselectedItems`, `selectedIds`, and `deselectedIds` arguments provide valuable information about the selection change. Use them wisely.
* **User Interface Updates:** You can update the user interface (UI) based on the selection. For instance, hide or show other widgets, display related information, or perform other visual updates.
* **Data Synchronization:**  If the selections impact data storage or need to be sent to a server, use appropriate APIs to synchronize the selection changes. 
* **Error Handling:** Consider error handling mechanisms in case of issues during the selection process.
* **VoltMX Iris Documentation:** For more examples, detailed information, and advanced usage scenarios, refer to the VoltMX Iris documentation. 
* **Community Forums:**   If you're facing specific issues or have questions regarding specific scenarios, consider utilizing the VoltMX community forums for support and discussions.

By following these steps and utilizing the onSelection event, you can effectively manage and respond to checkboxes selected within the CheckBoxGroup widget in VoltMX.

2024-08-09 07:27:47.722711 UTC,How to create a flex container,"To create a flex container in Iris, you have two main options:

1. **Using the Visual Builder:**
   - Open your Iris project and go to the ""Forms"" section.
   - Select the ""New"" option under ""Forms"" to create a new form.
   - In the form design canvas, you'll find a variety of widgets in the ""Default Library.""
   - Locate the ""FlexContainer"" widget  and drag and drop it onto the form canvas. 

2. **Using Code:**
   -  Use the `voltmx.ui.createWidget` function in your JavaScript code. You'll need to specify the `id` and any other desired properties for your container. 
   - Example: 
       ```javascript
       // Create a Flex Container
       const flexContainer = voltmx.ui.createWidget(""com.konylabs.widget.flexcontainer"", {
           id: ""flexContainerId"", //  Replace with a meaningful ID
           isVisible: true,
           height: ""100%"",
           width: ""100%"",
           layoutType: constants.CONTAINER_LAYOUT_BOX
       });

       // Add the Flex Container to your Form
       const form = voltmx.ui.getWidgetById(""FormId""); // Replace ""FormId"" with your form's ID
       form.add(flexContainer);
       ```

**Important Points:**

* **Layout Type:** The `layoutType` property in the code sample is set to `constants.CONTAINER_LAYOUT_BOX`. You might need to adjust this based on how you want to arrange widgets within the flex container.
* **Properties:**  You can adjust the `height`, `width`, and other properties of the flex container to fit the layout of your application.
* **Documentation:** For more information on the `FlexContainer` widget, its properties, and methods, refer to the Volt MX Iris Widget Programmer's Guide ([https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexContainer.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexContainer.html)).

2024-08-09 07:39:40.973132 UTC,"In Iris application, any widget that displays geographical locations on a map ","In Volt MX Iris, the **Map** widget is the primary component that displays geographical locations on a map. It leverages native maps, like Google Maps, to present the information. 

Here's how it works:

1. **Native Map Integration:** Iris uses the device's native map capabilities for platforms like iPhone and Android. This results in a seamless and optimized experience.
2. **Static Maps (If Native is Unavailable):**  For platforms that lack a native map widget, Iris integrates with Google Maps to display a static image of the map, complete with zoom and pan controls.
3. **Customization:** You can tailor the appearance and behavior of the map using properties like:
    * **MapKey:**  This sets the Google Maps API Key for accessing map data.
    * **Height:**  Controls the vertical size of the map widget.
    * **Skins:**  Allows you to apply visual styles to the map.
    * **Pin Images:** You can use custom images to mark locations on the map.
    * **Callout Templates:** You can create custom templates to display additional information about the location when a pin is tapped.
4. **Functionality:** The Map widget offers:
    * **Pin Markers:**  Display location points with custom pins. 
    * **Callouts:**  Show descriptive information about the pinned location when it is selected.
    * **Shapes:**  Overlay maps with shapes like circles, polylines, and polygons.
    * **Map Encoding/Decoding:**  Encode and decode map data for different purposes.
    * **Distance Calculation:** Determine the distance between two geographical coordinates.

To use the Map widget, you can add it visually in the Iris Builder, or through code using `voltmx.ui.createWidget`. You can find specific examples and details in the [Volt MX Iris Widget Programmer's Guide](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Map.html).

2024-08-09 07:42:42.176885 UTC,How to set a data into segment widget,"To set data into a Segment widget in Volt MX Iris, here's a breakdown of the process and considerations based on the information provided by the Volt MX Iris tutorials and documentation:

1. **Design the Segment Widget:** Using the Iris Canvas, drag the Segment widget onto the design area and position it according to your layout needs. You can then add widgets to the Segment widget to design the structure of your segment rows. Select the Group widget nested within the segment template, set the Orientation to Vertical in the Properties Editor, and add a second Group widget within.  You can then add the widgets you want in each row to the nested Group widget. If you need to create multiple rows, duplicate the nested Group widget using the context menu.

2. **Assign Data to the Segment:**  Click on the Master Data property of your Segment widget. This opens a data input dialog where you can provide row data for your segment. As you add rows, the changes will be reflected dynamically on the design canvas.

3. **Design a Row Template:** Create a new FlexContainer widget to design your row template. Add widgets like Button, Label, Image, etc., to represent the structure and appearance of each row.  You will be able to view the row template's real-time changes on the device canvas. 

4. **Assign Row Template to the Segment:** When finished, select your row template and assign it to the Segment widget. This tells the segment how to display data uniformly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Data Consistency:** Consistency is crucial! Every row in your segment should use the same template, allowing the data to display properly. If you need more visual variety, consider adding additional templates to your project.
* **Memory Usage:** If you use a large number of rows, it's important to be mindful of performance.  A segment that loads a lot of data and uses a complex template has higher memory usage. 

**Additional Resources:**

2024-08-09 07:46:36.952256 UTC,What is the use of voltmx.phone.addCalendarEvent?,"The `voltmx.phone.addCalendarEvent` API allows you to programmatically add events to the device's calendar within your Volt MX Iris application. This API function enables your app to seamlessly integrate calendar functionality directly into your mobile experience. 

Here's a breakdown of how to use it: 

1. **Import the API:** Ensure you have imported the `voltmx.phone` API module into your Iris project.

2. **Prepare the `eventDetails` Object:** Create a JavaScript object (called `eventDetails` in the documentation) containing the following information:
    - `summary`:  A brief description of your event.
    - `start`: A date and time string in the format ""dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss"" representing the event's start time. 
    - `finish`: A date and time string in the format ""dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss"" representing the event's end time. This value needs to be *greater* than the date and time specified in the `start` value.
    - `alarm`: (Optional) A number representing the time in seconds before the event's start time when you want an alarm to be triggered.

3. **Call the API:** Use the `voltmx.phone.addCalendarEvent(eventDetails)` function to add the event to the device's calendar.

**Example:**
```javascript
const eventDetails = {
    summary: ""Important Meeting"",
    start: ""25/04/2024 10:00:00"",
    finish: ""25/04/2024 11:00:00"",
    alarm: 300 // An alarm 5 minutes before the event
};

voltmx.phone.addCalendarEvent(eventDetails).then(() => {
    console.log(""Event added to calendar!"");
}).catch(error => {
   console.error(""Error adding to calendar: "", error);
});
```

Remember:
- **Permissions:** Your application will require proper calendar permissions to use this API. You might need to request these permissions from the user at runtime. (Refer to previous responses for guidance on permissions). 
- **Documentation:** For further details on the `voltmx.phone` namespace, functionality, and other available APIs, please consult the [Volt MX Iris API Developer's Guide](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.phone_functions.html).

2024-08-09 07:57:55.192070 UTC,How to request a permission at runtime,"To request runtime permissions in Volt MX Iris, you can leverage the `voltmx.application` namespace, which houses a set of APIs designed for this purpose. 

Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Import the `voltmx.application` Namespace:**  Add the following line at the beginning of your JavaScript code: 

   ```javascript
   const application = require(""com.konylabs.nativefunction.application""); 
   ```

2. **Request Permission:** Use the `voltmx.application.requestPermission` function to prompt the user for permission. This function takes the permission name as an argument. 

   ```javascript
   application.requestPermission(""android.permission.CAMERA"").then(granted => {
       if (granted) {
           // Permission is granted, proceed with using the camera
           // ... your camera code here ...
       } else {
           // Permission denied, handle this case
           // ... display a message, guide the user, etc. ... 
       }
   });
   ```

   **Important Note:**  The permission names are platform-specific. So, if you are targeting iOS, use the appropriate iOS permission name (for example, `NSCameraUsageDescription`).  For more information on specific permissions and names, check the platform documentation (Android or iOS). 

3. **Handle Permission Response:** The `requestPermission` function returns a Promise, allowing you to handle the user's response. Inside the `then` block, you'll receive a `granted` boolean value. 
   - If `granted` is `true`, you have permission to access the resource.
   - If `granted` is `false`, the user denied permission.  

**Example (Android):**

```javascript
// Import the permissions API
const application = require(""com.konylabs.nativefunction.application"");

// Request camera permission
application.requestPermission(""android.permission.CAMERA"").then(granted => {
    if (granted) {
        // Permission is granted, proceed with using the camera
        // ... your camera code here ...
    } else {
        // Permission denied, handle this case
        // ... display a message, guide the user, etc. ... 
    }
});
```

**Important Guidance:**

* **Error Handling:**  It's a good practice to use a `catch` block within the `then` function to handle any errors during the permission request.
* **Documentation:**  Refer to the Volt MX Iris API Developer's Guide ([https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/runtime_permissions.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/runtime_permissions.html)) for a comprehensive list of available permissions and detailed explanations on how to use the `voltmx.application` namespace.

* **Integration Services:** Think of these as individual connections to your backend systems. For example, you might have one for Salesforce, another for a REST API, and so on. Each integration service defines the specific interactions your app can have with that particular backend. 
* **Orchestration Services:**  These act like the ""glue"" that combines multiple Integration services together into a single, streamlined service.  Imagine needing to fetch data from both Salesforce and a custom API to display information in your app. Instead of making separate calls, you can use an orchestration service to handle both requests and return a combined result, simplifying things for your app. This approach can also improve performance and make your code more modular. 

In simple terms:

* **Integration:**  Connecting to individual backends.
* **Orchestration:** Combining those backend connections into controlled workflows.

However, it doesn't contain specific code snippets for creating dynamic widgets. The term ""dynamic widget"" implies a widget that changes its content or behavior based on user input, data updates, or other dynamic events.

To achieve this, you'll need to combine the widget creation methods with JavaScript functions to manipulate the widget's properties. Here's a general approach:

**1.  Create the Widget**

    *   Create a widget using methods like `kony.ui.Label`, `kony.ui.Button`, etc., as described in the provided context.

**2.  Define Dynamic Behavior**

    *   Use JavaScript functions to modify the widget's properties (like text, visibility, or styling). These functions can be triggered by events like user actions, data updates, or timers.

**Example**

Let's say you want to create a label widget that displays a dynamically changing countdown.

```javascript
// Create the label widget
var countDownLabel = new kony.ui.Label({
    id: 'countDownLabel',
    text: '10',
    skin: 'sknLblCountdown',
    isVisible: true
});

// Add to a container (flxMain in your case)
flxMain.add(countDownLabel);

// Implement the countdown function
function updateCountDown() {
    var remainingTime = parseInt(countDownLabel.text) - 1;
    countDownLabel.text = remainingTime;
    if (remainingTime > 0) {
        setTimeout(updateCountDown, 1000); // 1 second delay for the countdown
    } else {
        // When countdown is finished, do something here (e.g., show an alert)
        alert('Countdown finished!');
    }
}

// Start the countdown
updateCountDown();
```

This example demonstrates how you can use JavaScript functions to modify a widget's properties like the text dynamically. You can apply similar principles to change other aspects of a widget based on your requirements.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Event Handling:** Use VoltMX's event handling mechanisms to trigger the dynamic behaviors in response to specific actions, data changes, or other events.
*   **Data Binding:** For more complex dynamic scenarios, consider using VoltMX data binding features to automatically update widgets based on underlying data sources.

**Refer to the VoltMX Documentation:**

For detailed instructions on widget creation, event handling, data binding, and other related concepts, refer to the official VoltMX documentation: [https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/C_UsingComponents.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/C_UsingComponents.html).

2024-08-09 10:00:34.859567 UTC,How to add run time permissions for android and Iphone?,"To add runtime permissions for Android and iPhone in your VoltMX Iris project, you need to use the `voltmx.application.requestPermission` or `voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet` functions. This allows you to dynamically request permissions at runtime.

**For Android:**

1. **Open your VoltMX Iris Project:** Begin by opening your project in Iris.
2. **Navigate to Project Settings:** Go to **Project Settings > Native > Android**.
3. **Enable Necessary Permissions:**  You can find the **Permissions** tab in **Project Settings.** Check if permission for the required action is listed (e.g. CAMERA, RECORD_AUDIO). If the permission you need is not available, you can add it manually.
4. **Add Runtime Permissions Code:** In your Iris application code, add the following JavaScript code to request permissions using the `voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet` function:

   ```javascript
   function requestMicrophonePermission() {
     voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet(
       [ ""android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"" ], // Permission to request
       function() {
         // Permission granted - proceed with microphone usage
         console.log(""Microphone permission granted"");
       },
       function(error) {
         // Permission denied - handle the error
         console.error(""Microphone permission denied:"", error);
       }
     );
   }

   // Call this function when you need to use the microphone
   requestMicrophonePermission();
   ```

**For iPhone (iOS):**

1. **Add Permissions in Xcode Project:**  Open your Xcode project associated with your VoltMX Iris application. Navigate to the **Info** tab of your project settings.
2. **Add `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` Key:** Add a new key named `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` to your project's info.plist file and set its value to a user-friendly explanation of why your app needs access to the microphone.  This is crucial for displaying the permission request to the user.
3. **Add Runtime Permissions Code:** Use the `voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet` function in JavaScript, similar to the Android example:

   ```javascript
   function requestMicrophonePermission() {
     voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet(
       [ ""microphone"" ], // Permission to request
       function() {
         // Permission granted - proceed with microphone usage
         console.log(""Microphone permission granted"");
       },
       function(error) {
         // Permission denied - handle the error
         console.error(""Microphone permission denied:"", error);
       }
     );
   }

   // Call this function when you need to use the microphone
   requestMicrophonePermission();
   ```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Permission Groupings:**  On Android, permissions are often grouped into categories. If you're requesting multiple permissions, consider using `voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet` to request them together.  
* **Handle Permission Denials:**  Implement logic within your app to handle scenarios where the user denies a permission request. Provide alternative options or explain why the permission is needed.
* **User Experience:**  Present permission requests to users in a clear and concise way. Explain the reason for needing the permission and provide options for allowing or denying access.

**Remember:** The provided example code is a basic illustration. The specific permissions and their handling will vary depending on your application's specific requirements and the actions you are taking.

2024-08-09 09:55:30.989813 UTC,What is the use of identity services in Foundry?,"Identity services in Foundry are used to authenticate and authorize requests to backend servers.  When a service needs a backend token, such as an access token, to access a backend server, you can configure the Identity Service associated with your app. 

This Identity Service is then used to provide the necessary token to the backend server.  This ensures that only authorized users and applications have access to the backend resources.  

Here are some key points about using Identity Services in Foundry:

* **Backend Token:**  This is a token received from the Identity Service and is used to authenticate requests to the backend server.  
* **Externalizing Identity Services:** You can easily replace the Identity Service references in your Foundry app, which allows for flexibility in changing authentication methods or migrating to a newer Identity Service.  
* **Additional Configuration:** In the Advanced section of the Service Definition, you can further configure the Identity Service, like uploading a custom JAR file to filter the data sent to the backend.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a mobile app that needs to access customer data from a backend server.  The server requires an access token for authentication.  You can set up an Identity Service in Foundry to handle the authentication process.  When your app makes a request to the backend server, Foundry will use the configured Identity Service to generate the access token and pass it along with the request.  This ensures that the backend server recognizes the app as authorized and allows access to the customer data.  

By using Identity Services, developers can simplify the process of authenticating to backend servers, ensuring the security and integrity of their applications.

* **Methods:** These are functions that you can call directly on a component to trigger specific actions or retrieve information. For example, you might use a method to change the text of a label, hide a button, or get the current value of a text field.

* **Events:** Events are actions or occurrences triggered by user interactions or changes in the component's state. These events can be handled by writing code that executes when the event is detected. Common examples of events include:

    * **Tap:**  Triggered when a user touches a component on the screen.
    * **Change:** Triggered when the value of a component changes, such as a text field or a slider.
    * **Focus:** Triggered when a component gains focus, allowing you to perform actions related to the component's activation.
    * **Blur:** Triggered when a component loses focus, allowing you to perform cleanup or validation actions.

Here's how you can use methods and events effectively in a component:

1. **Define Methods in Your Component's Controller:** Use the `controller.js` file to write custom JavaScript functions that act as methods for your component. These methods can perform various tasks:
   
   ```javascript
   // In controller.js
   function myCustomMethod() {
       // Code for the method's functionality 
       console.log(""This method was called!"");

2. **Handle Events in Your Component's Controller Actions:** The `ControllerActions.js` file is where you write code to handle events triggered by your component. Use the Action Editor or write code directly in the `ControllerActions.js` file to define event handlers.

   ```javascript
   // Example in ControllerActions.js
   function onTap(eventobject) {
       // Handle the tap event for this component
       console.log(""Tap event detected!"");
       myCustomMethod(); // Call a custom method from the component
   }
   ```

3. **Access and Trigger Methods and Events:** You can access and trigger these methods and events from other parts of your application, such as within forms or other components, using the `kony.ui` API  functions.  For example: 

   ```javascript
   // In a form's JavaScript (form.js)
   var myComponent = kony.ui.getWidgetById(""myComponentId"");
   myComponent.myCustomMethod(); // Calling a component's method  
  ```

By utilizing methods and events, you can create interactive and dynamic components that react to user input and data changes, enhancing the functionality and user experience of your VoltMX Iris applications.

Remember, you can access further details on components, including  the use of methods and events, and their implementation in the VoltMX Iris documentation. The  ""Creating Applications With Components"" section in the VoltMX Iris User Guide should provide valuable information.

2024-08-09 10:24:00.372575 UTC,Explain the event handling mechanism in iris. How can events be triggered and managed across components?,"In VoltMX Iris, event handling is a fundamental mechanism for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.  Events are triggered by user actions (like clicks, taps, or swipes) or by changes in the application's state.  Iris provides a comprehensive set of predefined events and allows you to create custom events if needed.

Here's a breakdown of the event handling process in Iris:

1. **Event Triggering:**  Events are initiated by user interactions with components or by changes within the application.  For instance, clicking a button,  typing into a text field, or receiving data from a backend service can trigger events.

2. **Event Capture:**  Iris automatically captures events and stores them in a queue.  This queue holds pending events until they are processed.

3. **Event Handling:**  Iris allows you to write JavaScript code to handle events.  This code is executed when the corresponding event is triggered. 

4. **Event Handling Locations:**
    * **Component Level:** You can write event handlers directly within the `ControllerActions.js` file of a specific component. This enables you to handle events related to that particular component.
    * **Form Level:**  Events can be handled at the form level using the form's `ControllerActions.js` file. This allows for handling events that might affect multiple components within the form.
    * **Global Level:** For events that need to be handled across the entire application, you can use global event handlers in your main application file.

5. **Event Handler Code:**  Event handlers are JavaScript functions that are executed when an event is triggered.  The handler code can perform actions based on the event, such as:
    * Updating the UI.
    * Making API calls to the backend.
    * Navigating between screens.
    * Performing data validation.

6. **Event Propagation:**  Events can propagate within the component hierarchy. When an event is triggered, it can be handled by the component where it originated, by parent components, or even by the application's global event handler.

7. **Predefined Events:**  Iris provides a set of built-in events for common user interactions, like:
    * `onTap` for tap events on components.
    * `onChange` for value changes in components like text fields and dropdowns.
    * `onFocus` and `onBlur` for gaining and losing focus on components. 
    * `onRowClick` for click events on rows in lists or tables.

8. **Custom Events:**  You can define custom events within your components to handle application-specific scenarios.  Custom events are useful for creating unique behaviors and interacting with your application's logic.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a button on a form. You want to perform an API call when the button is clicked. You can handle the button click event by adding an event handler to the button's `ControllerActions.js` file.

```javascript
// In the button's ControllerActions.js file
function onButtonClick(eventobject) {
    // Call the API function
    myAPICallFunction();

    // Optionally, display feedback to the user
    kony.ui.Alert(""Button clicked!"", null, ""OK"");
}
```

This code defines an event handler function `onButtonClick`. When the user clicks the button, the `onButtonClick` function is executed, making the API call and displaying an alert message.

**For more detailed information on event handling and specific examples, you can refer to the VoltMX Iris documentation.  It contains a comprehensive guide to events, event handlers, event propagation, and the available predefined events.**

1. **Open your Iris project**:  Navigate to the ""Project"" tab within your VoltMX Iris project.
2. **Expand the Wearables folder**: Locate and expand the ""Wearables"" folder in the Project Explorer.
3. **Expand the Android Wear folder**:  Within the Wearables folder, expand the ""Android Wear"" subfolder.
4. **Expand the Forms folder**:  Continue expanding folders to reach the ""Forms"" folder.
5. **Select the desired form**:  Identify the form you want to set as the startup form and click on it. 
6. **Mark as Startup**:  Click the down arrow next to the form's name and select ""Mark as Startup.""

You can identify the startup form by looking for a green icon next to it.  The form you have marked as startup will be the first form to appear when the application is loaded.  

**Remember:** The first form created in the project is automatically assigned as the startup form until a new form is specifically marked as startup.  Remember to re-publish your application after making this change to ensure the update takes effect. 

For more comprehensive information on working with forms and their attributes in VoltMX Iris, refer to the official VoltMX Iris User Guide. It will provide detailed guidance on form functionalities and design.

2024-08-09 10:29:17.685826 UTC,What is the use of pre-processor ans post processors in Foundry?,"Pre-processors and post-processors in Foundry are Java classes that allow you to modify data before it is sent to a mobile device (pre-processor) or after it is received from the mobile device (post-processor).

**Pre-processors:**

These classes are executed before the data is processed by the object service. They can be used to:

* **Validate data:** Ensure that the data received from the mobile device is valid and meets the requirements of the object service.
* **Transform data:** Convert data from one format to another or modify the data based on business logic.
* **Enrich data:** Add additional data fields or information based on external sources or business rules.

**Post-processors:**

These classes are executed after the object service has processed the data. They can be used to:

* **Format data:** Prepare the data for presentation to the mobile device, perhaps adding specific formatting or restructuring the data.
* **Log data:** Record information about the request and response for audit or debugging purposes.
* **Notify external systems:**  Send notification about the successful or unsuccessful execution of the object service to other systems.

**How to configure pre-processors and post-processors:**

* **Select Java Classes:**  During the configuration of your object service, you can select Java classes from a list that implement the `ObjectServicePreProcessor` and `ObjectServicePostProcessor` interfaces.  These classes contain the custom logic for your data modifications.
* **Manage Order:**  You can set the order in which multiple pre-processors and post-processors are executed.
* **Advanced Configuration:** You can enable or disable pre-processors and post-processors and add new parameters to your service.

**Benefits:**

* **Code Reusability:**  Pre-processors and post-processors enable you to reuse your custom logic for different object services.
* **Increased Modularity:**  They allow you to separate your business logic from the core object service code, making it easier to maintain and update.
* **Improved Maintainability:**  By isolating custom logic, it becomes simpler to debug and troubleshoot issues with your object services.

**Example:**

Let's say you need to validate a user's age before they can access a service. You could create a pre-processor that verifies the user's age from a data source and throws an error if the age is below a certain threshold. Similarly, a post-processor could be used to format the user data for display in a mobile app.

These pre-processors and post-processors significantly enhance the flexibility and control you have over the data flow within your Foundry application.  Remember to consult the official VoltMX Foundry documentation for detailed information on using these features effectively.

These are standard JavaScript methods for working with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. Here's the difference between them: 

**`JSON.stringify`:**

* **Purpose:** Converts a JavaScript object or value into a JSON string.
* **Usage:**  ```javascript
    const myObject = { name: ""John"", age: 30 };
    const jsonString = JSON.stringify(myObject); 
    console.log(jsonString); // Output: {""name"":""John"",""age"":30} 
    ```
* **Output:** Produces a valid JSON string representation of the input object or value.

**`JSON.parse`:**

* **Purpose:**  Parses a JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object.
* **Usage:** 
    ```javascript
    const jsonString = '{""name"":""Jane"",""city"":""New York""}';
    const jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);
    console.log(jsonObject.name); // Output: Jane
    ```
* **Output:** Creates a JavaScript object from the input JSON string.

**Key Difference:** 

* **Direction of conversion:** `JSON.stringify` converts JavaScript to JSON, while `JSON.parse` converts JSON to JavaScript.

**Use Cases:**

* **`JSON.stringify`:**
    * Sending data to a server, where it needs to be transmitted as text.
    * Storing data locally in a format that can be easily loaded back into memory.
* **`JSON.parse`:**
    * Receiving data from a server, where it was transmitted as text.
    * Loading data from a local storage or file that was saved in JSON format.

2024-08-09 10:00:41.841032 UTC, What are uses of integartion services in foundry?,"Integration services in Foundry act as intermediaries between your Volt MX application and external systems or data sources. They facilitate communication and data exchange with these external elements, making it easier to integrate your application with other services. 

Here are some key ways integration services are used in Foundry:

* **Connecting to external systems:**  You can connect your application to a wide range of external systems, like databases, APIs, or other applications, using pre-built connectors or by creating custom ones.
* **Handling data exchange:** They handle the conversion and transmission of data between your application and the external system, ensuring compatibility and a seamless flow.
* **Enabling API calls:** Integration services provide a way to call external APIs directly from your Volt MX application, allowing you to access data and functionality from third-party services.
* **Simplifying integration:** They abstract away the complexities of direct connections to external systems, making integration easier and more manageable.
* **Centralizing integration logic:** Integration services allow you to centralize the logic for interacting with external systems, making your code more organized and maintainable. 

For instance, you might use an integration service to connect your Volt MX application to a payment gateway to process transactions. The integration service would handle the communication with the payment gateway, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely and that transactions are completed successfully. 

You can find more information about integration services in the Volt MX Foundry documentation, specifically in the section on API Management.  The documentation provides detailed instructions on creating, configuring, and managing integration services, as well as examples of how they can be used within your applications.

2024-08-09 10:13:51.433912 UTC,What is the difference between component with contract and without contract.,"A component with a contract provides a defined interface through a JSON file that specifies exposed properties, events, and methods. This contract acts as a blueprint for how the component interacts with other parts of the application.  

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

**Component without Contract:**

* **Similar to Masters in older Iris versions:**  Think of it as a self-contained unit with a controller and UI elements, but without a defined interface.
* **Less Control:**  You have less control over what aspects of the component are exposed to other parts of the application.
* **Simpler:**  Creation is usually simpler, making it a good choice for smaller or internal components.

**Component with Contract:**

* **Defined Interface:**  A JSON file (contract) precisely outlines the properties, events, and methods you want to expose to users of the component.
* **Increased Control:** You have granular control over what is accessible outside the component, promoting modularity and reusability.
* **More Complex:**  Creating and managing contracts adds complexity to the component development process but offers advantages in large applications.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Reusability:** When aiming for highly reusable components, employing a contract increases predictability and consistency in how the component is used.
* **Large vs. Small Applications:**  In large, complex applications, using contracts can help manage dependencies and maintain code organization. For smaller applications, components without contracts might be sufficient.

2024-08-09 10:15:50.119984 UTC,What are events and methods for component in Iris?,"Components in Iris provide both events and methods to facilitate communication and interaction.  Here's a breakdown:

**Events:**

* **Events** are signals emitted by a component to indicate that something has happened within it.  Other parts of your application (like forms or controllers) can ""listen"" for these events and react accordingly. 
* **Types of Events:**
    * **Predefined Events:**  Iris offers built-in events like 'onTouch', 'onClick', 'onFocus', and 'onKeyUp', which are triggered by user interactions or changes in state.
    * **Custom Events:** You can define your own custom events within your component to communicate specific actions or status updates to the rest of your application.

**Methods:**

* **Methods** are actions or functions that are part of a component and can be invoked from other parts of your application. 
* They provide a mechanism to interact with the component's internal functionality and manipulate its state.
* **Types of Methods:**
    * **Predefined methods:** Some components have default methods provided by Iris, like 'show' or 'hide' to control visibility, or `add` to add new elements.
    * **Custom Methods:** You can define your own custom methods to perform specific actions or logic within the component.  These methods can be invoked by any part of your application that needs to interact with the component.

**Practical Example:**

Let's say you create a ""User Profile"" component in Iris. It might have:

* **Events:** 
    * 'onUpdate' - This event might be triggered when the user makes changes to their profile information.
* **Methods:**
    * `getUserData` -  A method to retrieve the current user's profile data.
    * `updateUser` -  A method to update the user profile data based on changes made.

**How to Find Available Events and Methods:**

1. **Component's Documentation:** Refer to the documentation for each component you are using. It will provide a list of predefined events and methods.
2. **Component Contract:**  If a component has a contract, the JSON file detailing the contract would specify the exposed events and methods.
3. **Component Controller:** Examine the JavaScript code within the component's controller to identify custom events and methods you might have defined. 

For more in-depth details on creating and using events and methods, consult the Volt MX Iris User Guide.

2024-08-09 07:43:55.109405 UTC,How to set a data into segment widget at runtime,"Setting data into a Segment widget at runtime in Volt MX Iris involves using JavaScript to dynamically update the widget based on your data.  While the  Visual Builder is great for initial design, you can use code to make your Segment more flexible.  

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Prepare Your Data:**  You'll need an array of data objects, where each object represents a row in your Segment. For instance:
   ```javascript
   const myData = [
       { name: ""Item 1"", description: ""This is the first item"", icon: ""images/item1.png"" },
       { name: ""Item 2"", description: ""The second item here."", icon: ""images/item2.png"" },
       // ... more data objects
   ]; 
   ```

2. **Get the Segment Reference:**  Use the `voltmx.ui.getWidgetById` function to obtain a reference to your Segment widget:
   ```javascript
   const mySegment = voltmx.ui.getWidgetById(""mySegmentId""); 
   ```
   Replace ""mySegmentId"" with the actual ID of your Segment widget. 

3. **Update the Segment's Data:**  There are two main ways to do this:
   - **`setData` Method:**   This method is used to directly set the data. (You might need to use the `getWidgetTemplate` function to retrieve the Row Template):
     ```javascript
     const rowTemplate = voltmx.ui.getWidgetTemplate(""rowTemplate""); //  Get your defined template 
     mySegment.setData(rowTemplate, myData);
     ```
   - **`addData` Method:**  This method is for adding data dynamically. Use this if you want to add new rows without clearing out the existing data. 
     ```javascript
     const rowTemplate = voltmx.ui.getWidgetTemplate(""rowTemplate""); 
      for (let i = 0; i < myData.length; i++) {
        mySegment.addData(rowTemplate, myData[i]);
      } 
     ```

**Important Things to Consider:**

* **Template Matching:** Your data objects and the structure of your row template must match.  Make sure the property names in your data objects (like ""name"", ""description"", ""icon"" in our example) correspond to the IDs of the widgets in your row template. 
* **Performance:** Large datasets can affect performance.  Consider strategies like pagination or data virtualization to optimize your Segment's performance. 
* **Data Binding:** Leverage data binding features (if available) within Iris to automatically update the Segment whenever your data changes. This approach streamlines updating the Segment and maintaining data consistency.

**Additional Guidance:**

* **Documentation:** The [Volt MX Iris documentation](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Segment2.html) provides a detailed guide on the  `Segment` widget and its methods.
    
By following these steps,  you'll be able to dynamically update the Segment widget in your Volt MX Iris application with your data, creating an engaging and interactive user interface.

2024-08-09 07:56:02.001209 UTC,how to check for runtime permissions,"You can use the `voltmx.application` namespace to check for runtime permissions in Volt MX Iris. This namespace provides functions to:

* **Check Permission Status:** Use the `voltmx.application.checkPermission` function to determine if a specific permission is granted. 

* **Request Permission:**  Use the `voltmx.application.requestPermission` function to prompt the user for permission to access a specific resource.

* **Request Permission Set:** Use the `voltmx.application.requestPermissionSet` function to request multiple permissions at once. 

The status of the permission request is typically returned through a callback mechanism.  

**Example Code (Android):**

```javascript
// Import the permissions API
const application = require(""com.konylabs.nativefunction.application"");

// Check for camera permission
application.checkPermission(""android.permission.CAMERA"").then(granted => {
    if (granted) {
        // Permission is granted, proceed with using the camera
        // ... your camera code here ...
    } else {
        // Permission denied, handle this case
        // ... display a message, guide the user, etc. ... 
    }
});


// Request camera permission
application.requestPermission(""android.permission.CAMERA"").then(granted => {
    if (granted) {
        // Permission is granted, proceed with using the camera
        // ... your camera code here ...
    } else {
        // Permission denied, handle this case
        // ... display a message, guide the user, etc. ...

2024-08-09 05:43:42.775906 UTC,how signature capture widget is used to capture sign and save it,"To capture a signature and save it using the Signature Capture widget in Volt MX Iris, you can leverage the widget's events and the `voltmx.file` API for image saving.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Add the Widget:** Drag and drop the Signature Capture widget onto your Iris design canvas. Ensure it has a unique ID (e.g., `mySignature`).

2. **Event Handling:** In your component's `ComponentController.js`, define a function to handle the `onSignatureComplete` event triggered when the user finishes signing. Within this function, you'll retrieve the signature image data and save it to a file.

   ```javascript
   // ComponentController.js
   function onSignatureComplete(event) {
       // Get the captured signature image data in base64 format
       var signatureImageData = event.signatureData;

       // Choose a suitable path and file name for saving the signature
       var filePath = 'path/to/your/folder/in/workspace/captured_signature.png'; // Replace with your desired path

       // Save the signature image to the specified location
       voltmx.file.writeBase64ToFile(filePath, signatureImageData, function(success) {
           console.log(""Signature saved successfully at: "" + filePath);
       }, function(error) {
           console.error(""Error saving signature: "" + error);
       });
   }
   ```

3. **Bind the Event:** In your component's HTML file (or in the Iris Designer), attach the `onSignatureComplete` event to your Signature Capture widget, using its ID (in this case, `mySignature`):

   ```html
   <SignatureCapture id=""mySignature"" onSignatureComplete=""onSignatureComplete"" />
   ```

4. **Workspace Folder:** Choose the appropriate folder (e.g., `Common`, `Mobile`, `Desktop`, or `Native`) in your Volt MX Workspace where you want to store the captured signatures.

5. **Permissions:** Before using the Signature Capture widget, ensure your app has the necessary permissions to access the device's storage (if applicable, depending on the platform). 

**Additional Notes:**

* **Image Format:** The `signatureImageData` will be in base64 format, making `voltmx.file.writeBase64ToFile` the suitable function for saving it. Set the file extension in the `filePath` to `.png` or `.jpg` based on your preference.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling within the `onSignatureComplete` function to gracefully handle any issues during the signature saving process.
* **Storage Options:** You can explore other storage options, such as local storage or cloud storage, to manage your captured signatures.

   ```

**Complete Code Example:**

```javascript
// Component Controller 
function updateSegmentData() {
    // Your data (example)
    var myData = [
        { ""key"": ""1"", ""name"": ""Product A"", ""price"": ""10.99"" },
        { ""key"": ""2"", ""name"": ""Product B"", ""price"": ""25.49"" },
        { ""key"": ""3"", ""name"": ""Product C"", ""price"": ""15.00"" }
    ];

    // Access the Segment widget
    var mySegment = this.view.mySegment; 

    // Assign data to the Segment
    mySegment.setData(myData); 
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Dynamic Data:** If you're fetching data dynamically (from a service or API), you would call the `setData` method after retrieving the data.
- **Row Template:**  Make sure you have designed a row template (using a Flex Container with appropriate widgets) and assigned it to the Segment. This ensures that your data is displayed in a consistent format across each row.
- **Data Binding:**  For more efficient and dynamic data handling, consider exploring data binding features in Volt MX Iris, which can simplify the process of updating UI elements based on data changes.

2024-08-09 05:31:48.821408 UTC,how to set value to textbox in controller,"To set the value of a textbox within a controller in Volt MX Iris, you can leverage either the `setModel` method or a custom event mechanism. These methods provide flexible ways to update textbox values from your controller logic without directly accessing the textbox widget.

**1. Utilizing the `setModel` Method:**

   * **Controller Action:** Create a function within your controller that modifies the desired textbox value and then calls the `setModel` method, passing an object containing the updated value.
   * **Component's `setModel` Function:** Within the component's `setModel` function, use the passed-in model object to access the textbox widget using its ID and update its `text` property.

   **Code Example:**

   ```javascript
   // Inside the component controller
   function updateTextboxValue(newValue) {
       this.view.setModel({ textboxValue: newValue });
   }

   // Inside the component's setModel function
   function setModel(model) {
       // Access the textbox using its ID (e.g., 'myTextbox')
       this.view.myTextbox.text = model.textboxValue;
   }
   ```

**2. Implementing a Custom Event:**

   * **Controller Action:** Define a custom event within your component. When you need to update the textbox, trigger this event in your controller function, passing the new value as a parameter.
   * **Component's Event Handler:** Create an event handler within the component for your custom event. In this handler, use the event parameter to retrieve the new value and update the textbox widget's `text` property.

   **Code Example:**

   ```javascript
   // Inside the component's controller
   function updateTextboxValue(newValue) {
       // Trigger the custom 'updateTextbox' event
       this.view.fireEvent(""updateTextbox"", { newValue: newValue });
   }

   // Inside the component's 'updateTextbox' event handler
   function onUpdateTextbox(event) {
       // Access the textbox using its ID (e.g., 'myTextbox')
       this.view.myTextbox.text = event.newValue;
   }
   ```

**Remember:** Ensure that the textbox widget's ID is correctly set within the component's layout file or code.

       // Process the selected keys as needed.  
       console.log(""Selected Keys: "", selectedKeys);

       // Example: Update a label to display the selected keys.
       this.view.myLabel.text = ""Selected Values: "" + selectedKeys.join("", "");
   }
   ```

2. **Bind the Event:** In your component's HTML file (or in the Iris Designer), attach the `onSelectionChange` event to your CheckBoxGroup widget. Ensure you provide the correct ID for your CheckBoxGroup, such as `myCheckBoxGroup`:

   ```html
   <CheckBoxGroup id=""myCheckBoxGroup"" onSelectionChange=""onCheckBoxGroupSelectionChanged"" />
   ```

3. **Access Selected Keys:** Within your `onCheckBoxGroupSelectionChanged` function, the `selectedKeys` property in the `event` object contains an array of keys representing the selected checkboxes. You can use this information for subsequent actions in your controller, such as updating other widgets or performing data manipulations based on the user's selections.

**Further Exploration:**

* **Master Data:**  The `selectedKeys` will correspond to the ""Key"" values you defined in the `Master Data` settings for your CheckBoxGroup. Refer to the Volt MX Iris documentation for details on setting up `Master Data` ([https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/CheckBoxGroup.html](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/CheckBoxGroup.html)).
* **Dynamic Updates:** Use the `selectedKeys` property to dynamically update other widgets or perform actions in your application in response to user checkbox selections within the CheckBoxGroup.
* **Custom Styling:** Explore the `Selected Image` property and other skin options to personalize the appearance of your CheckBoxGroup widget.

This approach enables you to handle user selections within the CheckBoxGroup, gather the selected values, and perform actions based on these choices within your Volt MX Iris application.

2024-08-09 12:43:11.069089 UTC,do we have any APIs to encrypt ,"Yes, VoltMX Iris provides APIs for encryption through its **Cryptography API**.  This API allows you to encrypt and decrypt data using block ciphers. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**Key Concepts:**

* **Ciphers:**  Algorithms used for encrypting and decrypting data. VoltMX Iris supports block ciphers, which operate on fixed-length blocks of data.
* **Symmetric Key Encryption:** This type of encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. 

**Key APIs:**

* **`voltmx.crypto.encrypt`**:  This API function encrypts plain text data using the specified cipher, key, and initialization vector (IV). 
* **`voltmx.crypto.decrypt`**: This API function decrypts cipher text data using the specified cipher, key, and IV. 

**Example:**

```javascript
// Encryption 
var cipher = ""AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding""; // Example cipher algorithm
var key = ""yourSecretEncryptionKey""; // Replace with your secret key
var iv = ""yourInitializationVector""; // Replace with your initialization vector
var plainText = ""This is my secret message"";

var encryptedText = voltmx.crypto.encrypt(plainText, cipher, key, iv);
console.log(""Encrypted text: "" + encryptedText); 

// Decryption
var decryptedText = voltmx.crypto.decrypt(encryptedText, cipher, key, iv);
console.log(""Decrypted text: "" + decryptedText);
```

**Important Points:**

* **Key Management:**  Securely manage your encryption keys.  It's crucial that your keys are strong, kept secret, and stored securely (use a dedicated key management solution if possible). 
* **Initialization Vectors (IVs):**  Use a unique, random IV for each encryption operation to enhance security.
* **Cipher Selection:**  Choose a strong and widely-supported cipher algorithm like AES.
* **Security Best Practices:**  Always follow best practices for cryptography. Refer to the VoltMX documentation and trusted security resources for the latest recommendations. 

**Refer to the Volt MX Documentation:** For in-depth guidance on the Cryptography API, its usage, and best practices, refer to the VoltMX Iris documentation.

**Example 1:  Drawing a Simple Polyline**

```javascript
// Assume you have a Map widget named `mapWidget` in your form. 

// Define the coordinates for the polyline:
var coordinates = [
    { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060 }, // New York City
    { latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437 }, // Los Angeles
    { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 }, // San Francisco
];

// Draw the polyline:
mapWidget.addPolyline({
    points: coordinates, // Array of coordinates
    color: ""red"", // Color of the polyline
    width: 5, // Width of the polyline (in pixels)
    opacity: 1, // Opacity of the polyline (0 to 1)
  });
```

**Example 2: Drawing Multiple Polylines with Different Styles**

```javascript
// Assume you have a Map widget named `mapWidget` in your form.

// Define the coordinates for the polylines:
var route1 = [
    { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 }, // San Francisco
    { latitude: 34.0522, longitude: -118.2437 }, // Los Angeles
];
var route2 = [
    { latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060 }, // New York City
    { latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194 }, // San Francisco
];

// Draw the first polyline:
mapWidget.addPolyline({
    points: route1,
    color: ""blue"",
    width: 3,
    opacity: 0.8,
});

// Draw the second polyline:
mapWidget.addPolyline({
    points: route2, 
    color: ""green"",
    width: 5,
    opacity: 1, 
});
```

**Explanation:**

* **`addPolyline()` and `addPolylines()`:** These methods are used to add single or multiple polylines to the map.
* **`points`:**  An array of coordinate objects, defining the points of the polyline. Each coordinate object should have `latitude` and `longitude` properties.
* **`color`:** The color of the polyline.  You can use color names (e.g., ""red"", ""blue"") or hex codes.
* **`width`:**  The width of the polyline in pixels.
* **`opacity`:**  The opacity of the polyline (0 to 1).

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Interactive Polylines:** To make polylines interactive, you can attach event handlers to them (e.g., click events).  You can also set the `clickable` property to `true`.
* **Map Widget Initialization:** Make sure you have properly initialized the Map widget before adding polylines.
* **Coordinates:** Use accurate coordinates for your polylines. You can get coordinates from sources like Google Maps or other mapping services.

2024-08-09 05:45:52.135428 UTC,how to set 2D 3D transformations to widget?,"To apply 2D and 3D transformations to a widget in VoltMX, you can leverage the `voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform` function to create a transform object. This object allows you to manipulate the widget's position, rotation, and scale in both 2D and 3D space.

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Create a Transform Object:**

   ```javascript
   var transformObject = voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform();
   ```

2. **Apply Transformations:**

   * **Rotation:**
     * **2D:**  `transformObject.rotate(angle);` (angle in degrees)
     * **3D:** `transformObject.rotate3D(xAngle, yAngle, zAngle);` (angles in degrees for each axis)

   * **Scaling:**
     * **2D:**  `transformObject.scale(scaleX, scaleY);` 
     * **3D:** `transformObject.scale3D(scaleX, scaleY, scaleZ);` 

   * **Translation:** 
     * **2D:** `transformObject.translate(x, y);` 
     * **3D:** `transformObject.translate3D(x, y, z);`

   * **Perspective:** `transformObject.setPerspective(perspectiveValue);` (perspectiveValue is platform-specific)

3. **Apply Transform to Widget:**

   ```javascript
   widget.setTransform(transformObject);
   ```

**Example:** To rotate a widget 45 degrees around the Z-axis in 3D:

```javascript
var transformObject = voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform();
transformObject.rotate3D(0, 0, 45); 
widget.setTransform(transformObject); 
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Platform Support:** While 2D transformations are broadly supported across platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, SPA), 3D transformations might have limitations on certain platforms.
* **Animation:** You can combine these transformations with the `voltmx.ui.createAnimation` function to smoothly animate the widget's changes over time.
* **State:** Apply 3D transformations on widgets in their normal state to avoid undefined behavior.

2024-08-09 07:12:22.851091 UTC,how to create jasmine test case in iris?,"To create a Jasmine test case in VoltMX Iris, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open Iris and Navigate to Test Resources:** In the VoltMX Iris IDE, open your project. Then, navigate to the ""Test Resources"" folder in the Project Explorer.
2. **Create a Test Suite:**  Within the ""Test Resources > Jasmine"" folder, create a new JavaScript file to represent your test suite. You can name this file according to your testing conventions (e.g., ""myTestSuite.js"").
3. **Define Test Cases:** Within your test suite file, use the Jasmine framework's syntax to define your test cases.  Here's a simple example:

   ```javascript
   describe(""My App Test Suite"", function() {
       it(""should verify the button text"", function() {
           // Your test code here using the VoltMX APIs
           // For example, to verify the text of a button widget:
           var buttonWidget = voltmx.ui.get(""ButtonWidgetID""); 
           expect(buttonWidget.text).toEqual(""Click Me"");
       });

       it(""should check for form validation"", function() {
           // Your test code for form validation logic
       }); 
   });
   ```
 
   * **`describe` Block:**   The `describe` block groups your test cases together. The first argument to `describe` is a descriptive string for your test suite.
   * **`it` Blocks:** The `it` block defines individual test cases. The first argument to `it` is a descriptive string for the test case. The second argument is a function containing your test code.
   * **`expect` Assertions:** The `expect` function is used to create assertions within your test cases.  You use it to compare expected values to actual values in your application.

4. **Add Assertions:** Inside each `it` block, use the `expect` function to define assertions. Assertions are the checks you use to verify the expected behavior of your application. 

5. **Deploy and Run the Tests:**
    * **Deploy Jasmine:** Right-click on the ""Jasmine"" folder in the Project Explorer and select ""Deploy"". 
    * **Build in Debug Mode:** From the ""Build"" menu, build your application for the channel you are testing, selecting ""Debug"" mode.
    * **Run Your App:** Run your application on the target simulator or device. The test scripts will be hosted on the Iris node server, and your device should have access to this server.  Ensure your device and the system running the Volt MX Automator are on the same network.


**Example Test Case:**

```javascript
describe(""My App Test Suite"", function () {
    it(""should verify the button text"", function () {
        var buttonWidget = voltmx.ui.get(""ButtonWidgetID""); // Replace ""ButtonWidgetID"" with your actual button ID
        expect(buttonWidget.text).toEqual(""Click Me"");  // Assuming the button text should be ""Click Me""
    });

    it(""should check if the form is invalid when empty"", function () {
        var formWidget = voltmx.ui.get(""FormWidgetID""); // Replace ""FormWidgetID"" with your form ID
        expect(formWidget.isValid()).toBe(false); // Assuming the form should be invalid when empty
    });
});

```

**Key Points:**

* **VoltMX APIs:**  Use the VoltMX Iris JavaScript APIs to interact with your app's UI elements, data, and other functionalities within your test cases.
* **Network Access:** Ensure your device and the Iris node server are connected to the same network to allow the test scripts to execute.
* **Test Suite Runner:** VoltMX Iris provides a Test Suite Runner window (accessible by right-clicking a test suite file and selecting ""Run"") that displays the results of your tests.

2024-08-09 13:32:25.737020 UTC,Use of Clip Bounds on in FlexContainer?,"The `Clip Bounds` property in VoltMX Iris's FlexContainer is a powerful tool for managing content overflow in your applications. Here's a  breakdown of its function and how to use it effectively:

**Understanding `Clip Bounds`**

The `Clip Bounds` property controls whether content within a `FlexContainer` that extends beyond its boundaries is visible or clipped. You can use this property to achieve different visual effects and manage content display depending on the layout and content type.

**Key Points:**

* **Content Overflow:** Content that spills out of the `FlexContainer`'s defined dimensions is referred to as ""Content overflow.""
* **Clip Behavior:** When `Clip Bounds` is set to `ON`, content outside the `FlexContainer`'s bounds is clipped, making it invisible.  Setting it to `OFF` allows the overflow content to be visible.

**Practical Uses:** 

* **Preventing Unwanted Display:**  If you have a container that holds content that might extend outside of its predefined size, `Clip Bounds` can  prevent that content from disrupting the layout. 
* **Creating Visual Effects:** You can use `Clip Bounds` to create interesting visual effects. For example, you might have a container with scrolling content and only clip the content outside of the visible portion of the container. 

**How to Use `Clip Bounds`**

1. **Select the FlexContainer:** In your VoltMX Iris project, locate the `FlexContainer` for which you want to control content overflow. 
2. **Open the Properties Panel:** This panel is typically on the right side of the Iris IDE.
3. **Locate the Clip Bounds Property:**  Within the `FlexContainer`'s properties, find the `Clip Bounds` property.
4. **Set the Value:** Choose either:
    * `ON` (Clips content)
    * `OFF` (Allows content to overflow)

**Example Scenario**

Imagine you have a `FlexContainer` that displays a list of items. If the list is longer than the `FlexContainer`'s height, you can use `Clip Bounds` to make the entire list scrollable, but hide anything outside the visible portion.

**Additional Considerations**

* **Custom Widgets:** The `Clip Bounds` property also works with custom widgets in VoltMX Iris.
* **Responsive Web Channel:** This property is especially useful for web applications designed for different screen sizes, where content might behave differently on different devices.

For more detailed information about the `Clip Bounds` property and its use cases, refer to the official VoltMX Iris documentation: [https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Flex_Container.html#swipe-config](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Flex_Container.html#swipe-config)

2024-08-09 05:24:20.153328 UTC,How to map Foundry service variables to iris variables,"Mapping Foundry service variables to Iris variables is a crucial step in integrating your Foundry backend services with your Iris application. Here's how you can achieve this mapping:

1. **Invoke Foundry Service in Iris:** Start by adding a Foundry service to your Iris canvas. This service represents the backend operation you want to call from your Iris application.

2. **Define the Service and Operation:**  Provide the necessary information, including the URL of your Foundry instance and the specific operation you aim to execute.

3. **Map Service Results to Form:** In this step, you define how the data returned from the Foundry service should be represented in your Iris application.  Here's where the mapping occurs:

    * **Output Mapping:**  When configuring the Foundry service in Iris, you'll be presented with an area for output mapping. This section allows you to connect the data fields returned by the Foundry service to corresponding components (like widgets or data structures) in your Iris application.

    * **Use Global Variables:** You can leverage Iris's global variables mechanism for more robust data mapping. Define global variables in Iris that mirror the data structure returned by the Foundry service. Then, when you invoke the Foundry service in Iris, map the returned data fields directly to these pre-defined global variables.

4. **Visual Mapping Editor:**  Iris offers a visual mapping editor, which offers a user-friendly way to define the connection between Foundry service variables and Iris variables:

   * **Mapping Event:** The mapping event acts as the bridge between invoking a service and mapping the data.  

   * **Service Invocations:** When you add a service call to a form or FlexContainer, the mapping event becomes active.  

   * **Define Mappings:** Within the mapping editor, map the Foundry service response fields to Iris global variables or form elements.

5. **DataPanel (For Advanced Mapping):**  Iris also provides a DataPanel, which is particularly useful for handling complex data structures returned from Foundry.  The DataPanel allows you to design data models for manipulating and displaying data in your Iris application.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Data Types:** Ensure that the data types of the Foundry service variables align with the corresponding data types of your Iris variables to avoid unexpected errors.
* **Mapping Editor Warnings:** The mapping editor might issue warnings if the Foundry service utilizes custom XML mapping. In such cases, manual handling of data in your Iris code might be necessary.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly integrate data from your Foundry services into your Iris application, making both systems work together in a cohesive and efficient manner. If you're encountering challenges or need specific guidance on mapping individual variables, providing more context about the Foundry service and Iris elements you're working with would be valuable.

This API allows you to dynamically modify the skin properties of a widget.  Here's an example which changes the skin of a button depending on whether a dial attempt is successful or unsuccessful:

```javascript
// Assuming you have a button widget with id ""dialButton""
var dialButton = kony.ui.getWidget(""dialButton"");

// Define skins for success and failure scenarios
var successSkin = ""successSkin"";  // Replace with the actual skin name
var errorSkin = ""errorSkin"";    // Replace with the actual skin name

function makeDialAttempt() {
  // ... your dial attempt logic
  // ... 

  if (dialAttemptSuccessful) {
    // Apply success skin
    voltmx.theme.setSkinsProperties({
      ""widgets"": [{""widgetId"": ""dialButton"", ""skin"": successSkin}]
    });
  } else {
    // Apply error skin
    voltmx.theme.setSkinsProperties({
      ""widgets"": [{""widgetId"": ""dialButton"", ""skin"": errorSkin}]
    });
  }
}

// Call the function to make the dial attempt
makeDialAttempt(); 
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Define Skins:** You need to create the `successSkin` and `errorSkin` in the Volt MX Iris IDE. These skins will define the visual appearance (background, border, font, etc.) of the button for the success and error scenarios.
2. **Get Widget:** Use the `kony.ui.getWidget` function to retrieve a reference to the button widget using its ID.
3. **`voltmx.theme.setSkinsProperties`:** This API is used to dynamically change the skin properties of a widget.
   * **`widgets`:** This array holds objects representing the widgets whose skins you want to modify.
   * **`widgetId`:**  The ID of the widget. 
   * **`skin`:** The name of the skin to apply to the widget. 
4. **Success/Failure Logic:**  You'll need to implement your dial attempt logic and determine if it was successful or unsuccessful. Based on the result, you'll call the `voltmx.theme.setSkinsProperties` with the appropriate skin. 

**Important Considerations:**

 * **Skin Existence:** Make sure the skins (`successSkin` and `errorSkin` in this example) are already defined in the Volt MX Iris IDE before you execute the  `voltmx.theme.setSkinsProperties` API.
 * **UI Thread:** For UI updates (like changing the button's skin), it's generally good practice to ensure the changes happen on the main UI thread using `voltmx.runOnMainThread` to avoid UI inconsistencies.

2024-08-09 05:57:39.600861 UTC,how to apply skin dynamically to button widget?,"To apply a skin to a button widget dynamically in VoltMX Iris, you need to first create the skin in the IDE and then use JavaScript code to assign the skin to the button widget during runtime.  

Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create the Skins in the IDE:**  Begin by creating the skins that you want to apply dynamically. You can do this by following the steps outlined in the VoltMX Iris documentation:
   * Go to the ""Skins"" tab in the Project Explorer.
   * Click the ""New"" button (a plus sign) and select ""Skin"" from the menu.
   * Configure the properties of the skin, such as colors, fonts, and images.
   * Save the skin.
   * Repeat these steps to create all the skins you'll need for dynamic skinning.

2. **Use JavaScript for Dynamic Skinning:**

   * **Include Necessary Code:**
     ```javascript
     var widget = voltmx.ui.get(""ButtonWidgetID""); // Replace ""ButtonWidgetID"" with the actual ID of your button widget
     ```

   * **Dynamic Skin Assignment:**
     ```javascript
     if (dialAttemptSuccessful) {
         widget.skin = ""successSkin""; // Assign the ""successSkin"" created in the IDE
     } else {
         widget.skin = ""errorSkin""; // Assign the ""errorSkin"" created in the IDE
     }
     ```
     *  Replace ""successSkin"" and ""errorSkin"" with the actual names of the skins you created in the IDE.
     *  The logic within this code block should be adjusted to fit your application's specific requirements. For example, you might replace the  `if` statement conditions with checks for other events or data conditions that trigger the skin change.

3. **Ensure Skin Existence:** Remember that the skin files must exist in the IDE before you run the code. VoltMX Iris requires these skins to be properly defined and present in your project for dynamic skinning to work correctly.

**Important Note:** While you can dynamically change the skin of a widget, you can't modify the skin properties themselves through code.  All skin definitions and customizations need to be created in VoltMX Iris using the ""Skins"" tab in the IDE. 

For further information and detailed examples, refer to the VoltMX Iris documentation on [Dynamic Skinning](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/95/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Dynamic_Skinning.html).

2024-08-09 06:01:05.535707 UTC,how to determine proximity of beacon?,"To determine the proximity of a beacon using VoltMX, you need to leverage the Beacon API. This API allows you to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and retrieve information about their proximity. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Include the Namespace:** Begin by including the `voltmx.beacon` namespace in your JavaScript code.
2. **Register for Events:**  You need to register for events that will notify you when a beacon is detected and when its proximity changes.
   * **Beacon Found:** This event is triggered when a beacon is discovered. 
   * **Beacon Proximity Changed:**   This event is fired when the proximity of a beacon changes (e.g., from ""Near"" to ""Far"").  


3. **Start Monitoring:** Initialize beacon monitoring to start receiving proximity updates.
4. **Retrieve Proximity Information:**  Within the event handlers, access the proximity information for the detected beacon.

**Implementation Example:**

```javascript
// Include the Beacon namespace
var beacon = voltmx.beacon;

// Register for beacon found event
beacon.onBeaconFound = function(beaconInfo) {
    // Log the beacon's ID 
    console.log(""Beacon detected:"", beaconInfo.id);
};

// Register for proximity changed event 
beacon.onBeaconProximityChanged = function(beaconInfo) {
    // Retrieve proximity data
    var proximity = beaconInfo.proximity;
    
    // Log the proximity 
    console.log(""Proximity:"", proximity);

    // Perform actions based on the proximity
    if (proximity === ""Near"") {
        // Your code for near proximity
        console.log('Beacon is near.');
    } else if (proximity === ""Far"") {
        // Your code for far proximity
        console.log('Beacon is far');
    } else if (proximity === ""Immediate"") {
        // Your code for immediate proximity
        console.log('Beacon is immediate');
    } else if (proximity === ""Unknown"") {
        // Your code for unknown proximity
        console.log('Beacon proximity is unknown');
    }
};

// Initiate the beacon monitoring
beacon.start();
```

**Key Points to Remember:**

* **Beacon Configuration:** Before starting, ensure the beacons you want to work with are configured correctly, broadcasting the appropriate UUIDs and major/minor values.
* **Platform Compatibility:**  The Beacon API's functionality might vary slightly across Android and iOS platforms, so be sure to test thoroughly.
* **Battery Usage:** Be mindful of power consumption as continuous beacon monitoring can impact device battery life.


It is important to note that the 'proximity' is not a precise distance measurement. It is rather a classification based on signal strength.
